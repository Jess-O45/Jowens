BP 59015 Woodinville,Store Experience | Customer Dissatisfaction,"This store sucks. I returned 3 pieces of equipment after canceling all services. I was never given a receipt. When I called Xfinity to verify equipment return they didn't have a record yet. Being only 24 hours after the return, I assume it takes a few days to update in the Xfinity corporate system. I drove to the store the next day to ask for a receipt and was told their printers ""sometimes print and sometimes not."" When they don't, an email confirmation of the return is sent in 24 hours. I told the customer service guy it's already past 24 hours. So I'm supposed to wait and see what happens. I went to the Kirkland store today to help my mom work her equipment return and they printed a physical receipt. This store sucks and I hope the manager sees this review. Garbage.",1,25-Feb,59015

BP 59015 Woodinville,Store Experience | Staff | Dissatisfaction,People committing fraud work here. Veronica the customer service rep handled my mother in laws account and set up a new mobile line on my mother in laws account without her authorization.

Terrible !! She should be fired!,1,25-Jan,59015
"BP #1339 South Elgin, IL",Store Experience | Customer Dissatisfaction,"Horrible customer service. I went in because Xfinity straight up stole money from me. I ordered Internet and they sent me 2 pieces of equipment so when the tech came out he said I didn't need both. I tried to get him to take it but he said keep it. I was charged three times for unused equipment. I called Xfinity and chatted with an agent on my phone, they didn't resolve the issue. Instead they tried to upsell me cell service. I got fed up and went to this store. Luis took the equipment back then explained that because Xfinity has a policy of 30 days for the unused equipment he couldn't refund me more than $15. I said that was unacceptable and wanted to talk to a manager. He said there was no manager and to come back tomorrow. I've already wasted hours on this issue. And it's complete bullshit that there was no manager there. But whatever. I'll be looking for another Internet provider so they'll be losing almost $100 in business. But my whole point is Xfinity does this on purpose. They mailed me extra equipment so that they could then charge me extra every month. It's a trash company and I think everyone should know that what they're doing is wrong. Not only wrong but I'm surprised people just take it because they know they're one of the best Internet companies out there. But here's another thing they have money yet they choose to outsource customer service to other countries. Stop giving them business",1,25-Jan,1339

BP #51003 Lauderhill,Store Experience | Customer Dissatisfaction,"A rating of one star is undoubtedly excessive.
To begin, I must express my profound dissatisfaction with the customer service experience I encountered at this establishment. This is not an isolated incident, as I have previously sought assistance with various issues and was met with unhelpful responses and indifference. The representative’s attitude towards resolving my problem was clearly one of apathy.

BP #51012 Fernandina Beach,Store Experience | Long Wait Time,"This is our closest XFinity store. About 25 minute drive in heavy traffic. Did have a handicap parking spot out front. We headed over to a low table with two cushioned chairs. We were redirected to a counter height station with a single swivel  bar stool type chair. Despite their being two of us , one of whom is on a cane, we were not offered a second chair. I finally walked across the room and brought a chair for my disabled veteran husband so he could sit down. Visits to Verizon are never fast. I asked to use the restroom as it had been a long drive, but was told there were no customer restrooms. It was an uncomfortable time until we concluded our business and we were able to go to a local Cafe for coffee and use the facilities. Like many of the older stores, it is not well laid out to accommodate Customers with ADA needs. This was compounded by a complete obliviousness to the needs of their older, disabled customers.  Obviously training is needed here. I did manage, with some effort,  to find they did not have my correct email. As I have had this email  - with their company  - for 30 years, I was a bit disappointed.  Not our best experience. #ADA #XFINITY #phone #email #customer #bathroom",3,25-Jan,51012

He was helping someone so i waited. The customer walked out and told her daughter that was easier than i thought. He helped me with same concerned attitude. I belived he would take care of it. Then i hear they fired the only person who respectfully helped me and many others. No manager in the store? Ops consultant? This guy set us up to have cable run from the pedestal to our home. He made calls to get confirmation of the appointment. Odd that he followed up to ask how the install went. That was the only time I was asked if all was ok. I told him that kids were out playing around with the wires. He said they will be buried asap. With in 2 days the lines were buried. I recommended this guy to my neighbor. My neighbor was told rudely that the manager was fired. I can't imagine a customer service specialist being fired. For what? I don't know. I don't care why. I have gone out of my way to go to other stores and have never received respect since. The manager (Ops) gave me his card (i dont have it anylonger once i found out he was fired). I was surprised. Anyone with personal touch is hard to find. I'd like to know where he went. Anything he had control of was done on time. He had contacts of techs in the field that helped him fix issues. If they and I trusted him, he did not make promises he couldnt make happen. It was fixed any way. Customer issues were corrected and he would call for confirmation that the problem was no longer an issue. My wife and I have met others at this office and none made me feel comfortable. Promises not kept. They were tolerable but not the same. No accountability. Issues were pushed around because noone else knew how to respond and fill the request. The first time i visited i was told to call comcast. When I couldn't find him, I left called and cancelled all services. Security, every channel offered, home phone, and internet. I mentioned part of my reason for canceling. Poor human interaction. I saw and could probably feel what caused the representatives. Xfinity makes mistakes and to have a person you could ask for help from was by far more valuable that the services from Comcast. I won't mention his name because I can easily see there is relatiation. ""He got fired."" Was what my neighbor was told. For someone so helpful to get a bad rap is a terrible description. You fired a good one and the store still has issues.",2,25-Jan,51014

BP #52000 Seabrook,Store Experience | Customer Dissatisfaction,"If I could give 0 stars I would. This store is awful. We went in for a new iphone in October. The store manager Tom talked my husband into getting one as well. He told him with his trade in he’d be getting more money back than a new phone would cost him, and with all these promotions our bill would be cheaper. He signed our new phones up with new numbers and then switched our numbers to google voice. “To make xfinity think we’re new customers for the promo”. Said don’t worry, we’ll have our numbers tomorrow. We had to go back for them to switch them back for us. Then magically, we still had the two other phone lines but for by the gig lines. He said don’t worry you’ll never see a charge for them. We’re paying for two by the gig lines, we never got a credit for the trade in AND on top of it all… today I got an email that my order was completed today at the seabrook store. Well I wasn’t there today. I went in tonight and FOUR MONTHS LATER someone who worked there added another by the gig number with a “bring your own” iPhone 15 to my account. So now there’s 3 by the gig numbers. Five phone lines for two people that only use two numbers. NO ONE working there could tell me a thing. Manager doesn’t work past 5, how convenient.

At one point while we were waiting for something to finish loading, he noticed that our Xfinity cell phone plan was costing us more money than what we could be paying, while getting the same service. He just said, ""I can save you some money on your plan,"" and took all the steps necessary to make that switch. Thank you, Brian, for taking an interest and the time to make that change for us.

I went back to the store and the foreign worker just laughed at me. He was so useless. I asked what he thought was so funny. Didn't answer me. He was rude and kept asking me if I had plugged it in!

BP #52030 Bel Air,Store Experience | Staff | Dissatisfaction,By far thee worst place to come for a phone. Literally came in to pay off the remaining  balance on my phone ($152)  and to get a new phone. Got ran around in circles with no answers . The guys in there were all goofing around looking at something on a tablet and directed me to the new girl who couldn’t help me. I showed her on xfinity app how I could just purchase it there but thought since I was in area to stop in and do it in person. Went three store up to T-Mobile and ported my number over to them and a now saving money and they paid off my phone with xfinity.  The so called sales people that are in xfinity need to be trained in something other than 30 30 .. that’s all they can do is say hello when you walk in.,1,25-Feb,52030
BP #52030 Bel Air,Store Experience | Staff | Dissatisfaction,"My experience at this location today definitely deserves 0 stars if I had an option to rate this location lower I would. First the young lady who assisted my husband clearly was new and lacked professionalism, customer service skills , and lack of training. There were 3 other guys at the counter just chatting away instead of assisting her with basic questions we wanted explanations for. After listening to her stumble back and forth about why he could not upgrade in store due to having to pay for the full price of the device even though  the app showed something different. One of the guys finally came over to point her in the direction of an explanation which she rudely said well you should just order it online if the app is showing something completely different. We proceeded to leave the store due to lack of professionalism with your entire staff this location should be closed they don’t know much about anything but collecting money. Xfinity should spend more time training there employees on customer service and hiring staff that assist customers not give them some BS cause things require you to do your job, explain, and know what you’re talking about when the customers rebuttals your lack luster explanation. Also this little girl should be behind the scene not out dealing with customers just pure disgusting if you hate your job quit.",1,25-Feb,52030

BP #53014 Houston,Store Experience | Staff | Manager Complaints,"Ok, where do I start. 3 employees to help one customer. First employee had to get the manager. But the second employee left his customer, an older lady with her grand daughter, to spectate. The manager was trying to explain to the customer the process of her billing, but the customer had a bad understanding, so I don't fault Xfinity for that. However, that manager should have delegated better. That employee that was originally helping the customer could have been helping someone else as the manager assisted the original customer. Furthermore, she should have told the nosy employee to get back to work. But the  real slap in the face is the nosy employee, a male, told another employer ""Ugh, I'm just having one of my moments!"" while being rude. When the customer tried to explain to him that he's not professional, he commented ""It Doesn't Matter!"" What the hell kind of customer service are they teaching and allowing. While all this went on, a line had formed and nobody thought to ask the two other employees that were in the back to come out and help. That manager has to be retained and that ride, nosy employee should be fired.",1,25-Jan,53014

I'm actually writing this *from inside the store*, which should tell you everything you need to know. Upon entering, I was met not with a greeting, not with a smile, not even with a flicker of acknowledgement. Instead, I was treated to a masterclass in how *not* to run a business. The staff seem to have collectively forgotten the basic tenets of customer service. Waiting was apparently the order of the day, and eye contact? Forget about it. It's as if they've been specifically trained to avoid human interaction at all costs. The complete and utter lack of any discernible customer service skills is frankly appalling. ""Crap"" doesn't even begin to cover it. This isn't just bad service; it's an insult to the very concept of retail. I'd advise anyone considering entering this establishment to turn around and run in the opposite direction. You'll save yourself time, frustration, and a profound disappointment in humanity.

BP #54003 Cumming,Store Experience | Staff | Behaviour Issues,"In my forty years on earth I've dealt with some poorly run organizations, government and private alike, but XFINITY takes the cake. The incompetence from the people who run this company is mind boggling. Something as simple as moving to a new address has turned in to a complete disaster, and no one knows how to fix it. Getting someone on the phone is near impossible, and when you do they seem utterly confused as to why they can't ""activate"" my cable box. Their solution? To say ""please hold"" and then hand me off to a new person. The same thing happens with their online representatives. The last two times I tried to engage with their support team I was randomly hung up on and transferred to more than five people. It's a real game of hot potato and will happen for eternity if you let it.

So I went in to this store. Everyone is extremely rude and passive aggressive, and offer no solutions. Just more ""I dunno. Call customer support sir. I'm not authorized to make changes to your account. I don't know what the issue is."" What is the point of a brick and mortar store if the people who work there are completely incapable of solving or fixing anything? It seems their only purpose is to upsell you on internet, phone and cable packages that they LITERALLY CAN'T GET TO WORK. I'm starting the process of cancelling my service (another thing I was told they couldn't do in store) and it's already a nightmare.

Edit to the reply: The link in the reply is just a xfinity chat that does not help. I had to call into the Xfinity corporate multiple times to fix my plan. Thankfully I caught it early enough to fix the issue. I will never come to this location again.",1,25-Jan,54009

BP #54011 Rome,Store Experience | Customer Dissatisfaction,"Not happy with Rome Xfinity. When I ordered service online, I was given the option of picking my gateway from them or ship to my house. I order gateway and storm ready WiFi. Didn’t like storm ready WiFi so to return it I call Xfinity and they told me to return to Rome location. When I drove 45 mins to them, I was told they cannot take it back as they are not Xfinity store but third party store so I have to call Xfinity and have them send shipping label or go to Xfinity store. Not happy with customer service.",1,25-Mar,54011

BP #54011 Rome,Store Experience | Staff | Dissatisfaction,"This was my first visit to this store. Immediately, Erin walked up and asked us if she could help us?
She was very friendly and customer oriented.
We were in to update our service.
We told her what we were looking for and she got on her computer to do her best for us and she did.
* We went from streaming only to cable and streaming.
*We switched our mobile service to Xfinity Mobile from Consumer Cellular.
*We switched our speed on our Internet, because we were getting more than what we needed.
This to me was a lot to do, but she handled it like a PRO.
While we talked between ourselves deciding what we wanted, she never left us to help another customer. She listened to what we wanted while on her computer looking at what she could do and what bundles were available.
I have to say that you don't see this kind of loyalty nowadays.
I was very impressed with her professionalism. I definitely will be back even to make my bill payments. Great job, Xfinity in Rome, GA! You hit a HOME RUN!!!",5,25-Feb,54011

From the blatant racism, to the inability to actually interact with customers, everything to do with this store is just outright pathetic. I went in to get a very simple fix on a family members phone but ended up being in the store for two hours because an actual EMPLOYEE that works there and is being PAID to be there refused to help me. Not once did I have an actual associate help me fix the issue. The employees here are all lazy, loud, and extremely unprofessional. I highly recommend just taking your business elsewhere.

He even apologized for my wait, like it was any of his fault or control. (It definitely was not.) I was very happy with my experience today, and I hope the manager knows what a great crew they have.

BP #55017 Southfield,Store Experience | Staff | Dissatisfaction,"I recently had an extremely disappointing experience with Xfinity's customer service. From the moment we walked in, we were met with unhelpful attitudes and dismissive behavior. Instead of genuinely trying to assist us, the representatives kept suggesting that we ""try it on the app,"" completely ignoring our concerns.

What made this even worse was the blatantly racist behavior we encountered. The employees gave us weird looks and seemed unwilling to help. It was clear that other customers were treated more respectfully, while we were brushed off without any real support.

If Xfinity values its customers, they need to address the lack of professionalism and bias in their service. No one should have to experience this kind of discrimination when simply trying to get help with their service. This experience has made me reconsider whether I want to continue being an Xfinity customer.

BP #55021 Anderson,Store Experience | Customer Dissatisfaction,"FIRST OFF- Not the store. This relates to online customer service.  After almost 5yrs of service with this company, not one late payment, I get into a financial bind and was a month late. Attempting to talk to a live representative is like escaping Alcatraz. Absolutely the worst so far. You go online it's a ""virtual assistant"" who can seem to change its dialog but yet only understand 15 words in the whole language. I did speak with supposedly a live operator, the first time, who keeps my tied up msging for 45mins without any information on my account. I told her i had to leave. She then tells me theres a plan if I'm interested, I said i will have to call back.  For 2 weeks I attempted calling only to get automated operator, who also only understands 12-15 words key words to advance, like figuring out an escape room. I could not get a payment arrangement date for nothing. It started with 3/27 to 3/20 to 3/13 to 3/7 until unexpected on 3/2/25 my service is disconnected. I got a rep this day. Only to speak to 3 total. One just left the chat. And watch their help center states they have payment plans of min $50mo for 12mo. Not to the lady that just hung up. She didnt want to hear about their false information on the website. All this was my fault for getting behind. I understand that. But the level of customer service and availability with someone that can tell the truth and have a little professionalism...... ZERO.

This is the only positive thing I can say about my experience. I told the gentleman that I was there because I had an appointment at 11:30 and he gruffly told me they don’t make appointments. I asked why in the world did the website set me up for an appointment? He didn’t answer me. He asked what I needed. I told him I was there to cancel services and had brought in my equipment. He started to tell me he only needed the equipment no remotes,no cords. When I asked him if he needed my name and address, he gruffly said “no just the equipment”. When he asked me the reason for my canceling services, I wanted to tell him none of your blankety-blank business, but I told him “because it’s too expensive”. He handed me a receipt for the equipment and walked away to place it in a bin. He never tried to explain anything to me. So… I walked out. Honestly, this experience with this rude man validated my decision to cancel services. I have been there before and have never been treated so rudely.

BP #55025 Avon,Store Experience | Staff | Behaviour Issues,"I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the appalling customer service I received at this location from a store manager named Drew. I believe this matter requires immediate attention as his behavior was unprofessional, disrespectful, and completely unacceptable.

I recently contacted Xfinity Customer Service regarding an unexpected activation fee on my bill. The representative advised me to visit the store where my phone was activated to request a refund. Upon arriving at the store, Drew, the manager, looked up my account and insisted that the activation fee was tied to an agreement I had approved via text on December 20th. While I acknowledged that I had approved a text message to complete the activation, I emphasized that no one verbally informed us of this fee at the time. My 77-year-old father, who does not speak English, was instructed to approve the text without any explanation of what it entailed.

Instead of addressing my concerns professionally, Drew adopted a dismissive attitude, repeatedly stating, ""I'm just telling you what happened."" I explained that I had been present during the phone activation and clearly remembered the events. Nevertheless, he continued to insist that I should contact customer service and refused to provide any further assistance. Despite my attempts to explain that customer service had already directed me to his store for the refund, Drew rudely insisted he had ""no time to go back and forth.""

To make matters worse, Drew repeatedly called me ""sweetie"" throughout our conversation—a term that was both condescending and inappropriate. As a manager, such behavior is not only unprofessional but highly disrespectful. It was clear that Drew had no intention of resolving the issue and was instead determined to brush me off.

Ironically, after Drew refused to help, one of his employees spoke with us, understood the situation, and within minutes called the district manager. Shortly after, we were reimbursed for the activation fee. This employee's quick thinking and professionalism starkly contrasted with Drew's dismissive and unhelpful attitude.

I expect Xfinity to take this complaint seriously. Customers deserve to be treated with respect and courtesy, especially by someone in a managerial position. I am requesting that Drew's conduct be addressed appropriately, and I would appreciate confirmation that this matter has been escalated to the appropriate leadership.",1,25-Mar,55025

We walked in trying to change a phone line where he provided first the incorrect instructions, then as questions were raised provided absolutely help in solving our problem outside of the words “well, I don’t know”, so our issue remains unsolved. He then followed up by asking that we stop coming in for help since it would mess with their walk in service counting metrics. The only reason we had to walk into that black hole of a store three separate times today was because of their inability to help with our issue or provide any information. If anything their metrics of multiple walk ins with little service would be indicative of their store. If you want actual help I would recommend looking somewhere else.",1,25-Feb,59004

BP #59006 Davis,Store Experience | Long Wait Time,"Stopped in twice. The first time we were already frustrated with Xfinity the company, with the upselling, lies, and hours on the phone to customer service. We had gotten good service at the Santa Fe, NM store, and that first time into the Davis store, the staff was as helpful as they could be and we were pleased with the support from manager Jordan, who gave us his card. Then, this week, with our problems having gone from bad to worse (long story short: the online team upsold us and lied to us about upgrading mobile service and devices) the manager HID in the back of the store. He KNEW we were there, we waited for over an hour while he was ""in a meeting"" then another hour when he was supposedly ""on the toilet"". Worse than a preschool child! He knew why we were there and there was no chance to make any commission so what was the point of helping us? Salesperson Cody and another colleague whose name we didn't get were helpful, but there is only so much non-managers can do. We feel so sorry for any Xfinity employee who isn't an immature, lying child and must deal with colleagues like this manager, Jordan Watson. To be clear, Comcast is to blame for the horrible corporate structure which creates a work climate and incentive system which ends up with employees who cheat and lie to their customers. We have lost HOURS of our time dealing with this ""great deal"" and will end up with a worse mobile situation than we started with!",1,25-Jan,59006

Being a customer service employee myself I understand frustrated customers can be difficult to deal with but the way I was treated today was uncalled for.
These people LITERALLY IGNORED ME helped a customer that walked in AFTER me and then kicked me out for being upset about that, as if they wouldn't have been bothered if it had been them. I've been customer for over TWENTY FIVE YEARS .

I understand that Xfinity has pretty much a monopoly in this area but I urge you to find another way. Find another outlet to help you with new service as I can assure that the current management doesn't give a damn about you or your issues.

I simply toggled it off and continued using my Verizon number. Figured it didn’t affect me anyway. Fast forward I get a $29 charge from Xfinity Mobile for an E-Sim activation and would be charged after a year for cellular. Corporate deactivated the account and waived the charge.

Overall, we don’t have issues with xfinity. We have a family member who works for Comcast and usually things are fine.

I am HORRIFIED at the customer service at this location. The employees seem to be uneducated on solving problems. They don’t understand their own interface. We are sitting here for the THIRD time this year trying to get a phone set up (new phone purchased through xfinity with the previous phone being on the xfinity) So we are on our third trip here because for whatever reason the phone has not transferred contacts, messages, apps and other data.

We have been here about 40 minutes. The guy helping us has tried a few “tricks”. He disappeared into the back for twenty or so minutes. We sat here waiting for the data to transfer. When he came back he said “so it’s time for me to leave, you guys can hang out until we close at 8pm (it’s currently a little past seven and we’ve been here since six) or you can try and leave but that should work so you should be fine.”
And he clocked out and left. I am appalled at the lack of customer service. If this was a call center you don’t get to say “hey it’s time for me to clock out” and hang up- the fact the employee left and our problem is unresolved is RIDICULOUS.

So here we are “hanging out” for an undisclosed amount of time, WITHOUT OUR PROBLEM SOLVED. AND NO EMPLOYEE HELPING US.

Not to mention the employees at this location REPEATEDLY told us to go to Best Buy for help with our XFINITY products??
This establishment is an EMBARRASSMENT for Comcast.

Took over 40 mins, still haven’t answered so now I have to go in store. Second, I got a charge of 70$ on my bank account for a mobile line that I never wanted. Told them multiple times I did not want the phone line and still got charged. Now they are not going to refund my money unless the store has a note saying I never wanted the line. Still trying to get this resolved bc I’m a sahm and they took the money out when I didn’t even have money on there so my account is in the negatives now thank to them.

BP #59054 Yosemite,Store Experience | Long Wait Time,"Xfinity Store Customer Service Review – Poor Experience

1. Lack of Customer Engagement:
Staff seemed uninterested and unapproachable. There was minimal effort to acknowledge customers upon entry or offer assistance.

2. Long Wait Times with No Clear Communication:
Wait times were excessive, and there was no clear system in place to manage customer flow. Employees did not provide updates or estimated wait times.

3. Unhelpful and Rushed Assistance:
When finally assisted, the representative seemed rushed and unwilling to provide detailed explanations. Questions were met with vague or dismissive responses.

4. Poor Problem-Solving Skills:
Employees lacked knowledge or initiative to resolve basic issues. Instead of troubleshooting, they directed customers to call support or visit another location.

5. Inconsistent Information:
Different employees gave conflicting answers regarding plans, promotions, and troubleshooting steps, leading to confusion and frustration.

6. Lack of Professionalism:
Some employees displayed an unprofessional attitude, appearing disinterested or even impatient with customer inquiries.

7. Lack of Sense of Urgency:
Staff did not prioritize customer concerns or show any urgency in resolving issues, even when problems were time-sensitive. Customers were left waiting unnecessarily.

8. Store Atmosphere & Cleanliness:
The store was disorganized, with limited seating and unclear signage. The overall environment felt unwelcoming.

Overall Rating: 1/5
The visit was frustrating due to poor service, lack of urgency, and an unhelpful staff. Improvements in training, customer engagement, and efficiency are needed.",1,25-Mar,59054

The other account holder was not present so we did what we could with the one and returned as instructed to complete the process. Not only could we not complete the process, but the young boy (Corbin) that ""helped"" us and the ""assistant manager"" in the back (Nate) said even with the account holder now present we had to leave and call the Xfinity number for help. They could not do anything. Even upon trying to take care of the trade-in, they said they could not do it for 24 hours. Lovely. Not the steps of direction we have been given during our first actually helpful visit. We had scheduled the time to get both account holders to the store only to be told by two kids that their assistant manager said nothing could be done there.

There is a promotion where you can get a free phone, but when I first asked my brother about it, he said he didn't want to contract it and didn't want to take it.

But a little later, my brother changed his mind and said he would take the free call.

However, the salesperson who helped him with this process took so long that everything was delayed a lot.
And she didn't even listen to his saying he would take the phone, and later she said, ' your sister said he refused'.
Even if I had spoken, she didn't listen to what he asked for.
Since it was almost closing time, the salesperson said he would do it when he came tomorrow morning.

This morning,
My brother closed his store and went there when the store opened.
but the manager said that since he had already open a phone line yesterday, he couldn't receive the free phone promotion today. The reason was that he was already a customer of this company. This promotion was for new customers.
My brother doesn't speak English well, and he had to go to work, so he just came back.

The associates also added a ""xumo"" streaming box to my plan and I never once was asked if I wanted it or even alerted that it was added on before I left the store, and there was a monthly $15 charge for that.
Thankfully I called the customer service and they were able to help me change the agreement.

Long story short, his stroke of brilliance resulted in me getting double charged for one month, then my billing being messed up, and my service subsequently being turned off at home. I went back in when I first realized things had gotten thrown off, and Valentino resorted to gaslighting me and telling me it was stuff I’d asked for and that he was only trying to help me out of the kindness of his heart.

BP #59066 Oakland,Store Experience | Staff | Behaviour Issues,"I came to the store last week and received excellent customer service, however, when I came today, I was completely offended by how I was treated by the young man working there. Instead of greeting and welcoming me when I walked into the store,  I had to ask if he worked there. He wasn't wearing anything with the Xfinity logo, but he said ""yes."" Then he ask if he could help me, with an attitude like he really didn't wanna help me. Instead of being focused on my needs as a paying customer, he was sitting down and talking with a friend not about Xfinity, but about riding bikes. Maybe he was on break, but he should've said something if he was.

I informed him that I may have left my ID at the store last week and asked if there was a lost and found where he could look.  He said that they didn't have anything like that at the store, and that the representative who help me last week was not there. I asked him again if they had anything like a lost and found, then he says that he would call the representative from last week. But while calling, he starts going through his phone, looking at pictures while continuing to talk with his friend until I asked him if he was calling the other representative. He called and said there was no answer. I looked at him and asked him if there was any where he could check to see to see if my ID was there. Then he said he'd go in the back and ask the representative he was trying to call on the phone, right after saying he wasn't in the store.

He goes to the other representative and said, ""This dude said he lost something last week like an ID or something."" It really bothered me that a young black man did not have the respect for an older black man to know not to call me ""this dude.""  I respected him as a young person and here I am in my mid 60s still disrespected.

Then, after asking the other attendant he found my license and gave it right back to me.  They had a lost and found, but he was just being too in hospitable and unprofessional to check and respect me as a customer. When he gave me back my license, he laughs, and makes no apology for his error Because I had a nice experience last week I rate at the store as level 2.  But my experience from last week to this week was like night and day.  This store needs to do a whole lot more to train its representatives, like him, in professionalism. Maybe he's not at fault but the stores fault for not helping him.  Give him more training.  This almost makes me want to close my account Xfinity.

BP #59072 Albuquerque,Store Experience | Staff | Behaviour Issues,"The only reason I’m rating it 2 stars is because they made up for their mistakes. I’ll start with the manager Anthony… USELESS! ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS! RUDE TO HIS EMPLOYEES! I came in to get WiFi, Miguel was super helpful and was the only one that helped me. He convinced me to bring my whole family over for phone service as well and for some reason it caused a lot of issues. Spent 4 days dealing with this situation and probably 10 hours at Xfinity store figuring it out. The only reason why I’m rating it a two star is because Dan, Miguel, Matt, and Fox made the experience much better and were dedicated to fixing the phone issues. Miguel even took calls after hours, stayed after hours and came in during his day off to help me figure it all out. I will recommend Xfinity to others but I will tell my full experience.",2,25-Mar,59072
"BP #59073 San Jose, CA",Store Experience | Customer Dissatisfaction,"Terrible store. Teenagers were on their cellphones texting cute little emojis  while customers waited in line. They also have zero idea of what they are talking about. It was as though they were wingin’ it and were not trained.

One did not know how to add a monthly modem to my account and told me that I had to buy it outright. They also did not know how to print off a receipt.

They set up the device completely wrong and when I went home it was as if I just walked out of the store with it. Not even on my account.

I went to return it the next day and the kids were on their phones again and said that they were not shown how to do returns yet. Then they went on to explain that it was not a real Xfinity store anyway, so that was the reason.

Xfinity #1110 Charleston,Store Experience | Customer Dissatisfaction,"On January 6, 2025, I entered in xfinity store to pick up my Internet equipment  I signed up for on January 5, 2025.

The staff member ( looked like a manager, not sure) told me the internet  equipment is being shipped to my address.

In order for me to get the Internet equipment, he will have to charge me $500.

I told him no thanks , since it's being shipped that's ok .

I walked out peacefully out of the store.

Here's the thing that ticked me off .

The Customer representative at Xfinity 1 800 number ( Jan 5) told me  I can go to Xfinity store to pick up the equipment.

But  like I mentioned above I couldn't do that.

After leaving Xfinity store, I called Xfinity customer service ( Jan 6, 2025).

They told me the internet equipment wasn't being shipped, but they could ship it for me.

I told them to ship the internet equipment since Xfinity store on international Boulevard  don't want to give it to me for free.

I had a better customer service experience at Xfinity one 800 number than xfinity store 5037 International Blvd. In North Charleston, SC.

Xfinity needs to train the staff people, including Management , how to read the account information for somebody like me that signed up for Xfinity Internet service and Xfinity mobile service.

But 95% of the time , the best customer service for any issue is xfinity's 1 800 number , not its store.

I left after 30 minutes of trying to explain what I wanted but all I got was "" its okay bro just buy this it'll be fine "" . I called xfinity rep and got it handled .

Xfinity #1130 Decatur,Store Experience | Customer Appreciation,"After visiting numerous xfinity stores throughout Georgia. I could honestly say this has been the best location period they are very attentive, greet you when you enter, and definitely have an organized system. This is a model of what all Xfinity stores should be like.",5,25-Jan,1130
Xfinity #1130 Decatur,Store Experience | Customer Dissatisfaction,"I had a very interesting morning at this store when I went to exchange a modem. As I waited, I noticed—just as many reviews have pointed out—that there was no sense of urgency or respect for people’s time. One employee was helping a single customer for 30 minutes, and the entire process felt painfully inefficient. I’ve been to this store before, and unfortunately, this seems to be the norm. So, if you have an abundance of spare time and enjoy watching inefficiency in action, this is the place for you!

But the real highlight of my visit wasn’t just the inefficiency—it was the fascinating encounter I had with a very *special* type of person.

When I asked for the manager to voice my concerns, an employee—who had been welcoming customers at the door—responded with, ""I'm business, and I don’t report to anyone in this store."" Um… okay, dude, that wasn’t even my question. But if you don’t know who the manager is, maybe just say that?

As I stood there, waiting to speak with someone about how inefficient everything was, before anyone relevant could even hear me, another customer, who had been working with the employee since I entered the store—suddenly turned to me and said, ""You are crazy."" And then he just kept going.

At first, I actually thought he worked there. But no—he was just another customer. Who are you? Are you the manager? His comment naturally made me angry, and then this individual did something even more bizarre: he threatened to make a YouTube video of me.

A store employee was standing right there and did nothing.He didn’t ask this other customer to stay out of it, didn’t intervene, didn’t remind him that it wasn’t his place to get involved. Nothing.

At that point, I had to tell this random customer—who had verbally insulted me—that I was not engaging with him. My concern was with the store, and I was only interested in speaking with the manager.

,I finally got to meet one of those *species* that lurks in society, the ones who interfere in things that aren’t their business, provoke people, and then whip out their phones to film the reaction.

I had only heard about them before.

But today, I saw one in the wild.

The store needs to ensure that customers can voice their concerns without interference from others. Allowing random customers to jump in and escalate situations is unprofessional and unacceptable.",1,25-Feb,1130
Xfinity #1130 Decatur,Store Experience | Customer Dissatisfaction,"So, it is unfortunate that I see all the bad reviews about this location. I live in Covington and the location near home told me that I needed to go by the location in Decatur to get my problem handled. Luckily, I work in Decatur so that was not a problem after work. I walked in everyone pretty much greeted me with a WELCOME. I explained my situation and when I tell you they were able to get the job done I was surprised. JT knows her job and she knows how to handle all this new technology. It took quite a while even after the store closed she was not leaving until we got the situation handled. Like I said before everyone was very attentive and very professional in getting things done for customers. THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN FOR YOUR HELP!! BTW the people over the phone are complete idiots. From now on, I will go into the store instead of getting on the phone. Hopefully, I do not have to see you guys too soon LOL!!!!",5,25-Mar,1130
Xfinity #1130 Decatur,Store Experience | Long Wait Time,I'm coming  here returns equipment waiting 1 hours please 🙏,1,25-Feb,1130
Xfinity #1130 Decatur,Store Experience | Long Wait Time,"Monday, February 3, 2025 at 3:30 PM

The associate working at the front (black girl with glasses) who asks for names & quotes wait times is extremely petty, insolent and callous. She should not be in a front facing position for Xfinity or any establishment.

I came in to return equipment. The girl at the front asked for my name, I gave it to her and asked her the wait time. She quoted me a 15-20 minute wait. Her disposition in that very short interaction was bordering on rude but I ignored it. I went outside to my car to grab my laptop to get some work done while I waited. Not too long after that, an associate came to tell me that he was ready to assist me. I asked him if I could be given a moment to quickly finish something on my laptop. He politely obliged and pointed toward the desk I could meet him at after I was finished. The girl at the front witnessed this interaction and immediately told another customer to go to the desk of the guy who just came over to me.

I stood up and asked the girl why she did that. Very coldly she said ""we have a line"". So I told her that he JUST came over to me so again I asked why she would do that? She looked at me, turned around and motioned for another associate. The other associate asked what happened, I told him what transpired to which he responded “did she know that you asked the other associate for a minute”. I told him that she absolutely witnessed the exchange and did what she did on purpose. Her response to me when I asked her why she gave my spot away solidified that she did it on purpose and she stood on it.

The appropriate way to handle this situation would have been to tell me that she needed to offer my spot to another patron prior to giving my spot away less than 30 seconds after I was approached by the male associate. If me sending a quick email before getting up to be seen was unacceptable, the male associate who I asked should have told me that they could not spare a minute to wait and needed to assist the next person in line. It was really that simple.

It is unfortunate that a power tripping, ill-mannered associate made what should have been a quick and seamless transaction, unpleasant and unjust.",1,25-Feb,1130

Xfinity #1131 Fayetteville,Store Experience | Customer Dissatisfaction,"Xfinity prices and the internet/phone service itself is great, but I swear all the money went to that and nothing else. The website loads as if I'm on dial-up (1000mbps download speed at home btw) and trying to give them money so you can get your product is a terrible experience; I might as well have slammed my hand in between a car door repeatedly as I'd likely enjoy that more. This causes my trip to this xfinity store, I check in very promptly and get told to wait until an associate can help me, sure no problem. That is if it didn't take 2 HOURS for me to get help, maybe that's on me for not being rude to the employees so I could get help faster but I learned my lesson I guess. I finally get help and the trade-in of my phone is going smoothly until she tells me my trade-in is worth only $700 as opposed to the $1000 I checked on the website literally an hour prior to my visit.

TLDR: If you plan on going with xfinity because of their competitive pricing and DECENT services; be prepared for terrible customer service both online and in-person.",1,25-Mar,1131
Xfinity #1131 Fayetteville,Store Experience | Staff | Dissatisfaction,"My 82 year old mother visited this store in Fayetteville, GA and was met with rude unempathetic customer service reps. When she walked in, none of the reps sitting around spoke to help instead expecting her to know what she should do. Then when she did get some help, they wouldn’t help her with her phone because her phone is under her husband’s name…no one offered a solution, like let’s call your husband to find out more. She just needed help
To find out why she couldn’t receive or make calls. This phone is her life line.  She was finally told she needed a SIM card and they didn’t even offer help. She was very overwhelmed and frustrated. These “customer service” reps need to remember why they are there. To serve their customers and older people may need a little more understanding and help.

Xfinity #1302 Morton Grove,Store Experience | Staff | Behaviour Issues,I would like to personally thank the most helpful tech there his name is Ali. We came in with the hopes of transferring services from Tmobile and he made this transition painless. He went above and beyond to help us step by step with paying off our devices from previous carrier so we were able to use them with xfinity. He also provided us with the promotion that were available making our visit so pleasant and affordable. He was very patient with me and my mother in law and even came in on his day off to make sure we were taken care of. I am blown away by the gentlemens customer service and his attitude. He is the vision of this company. He values us and kept assuring us things will work out just fine and they did. The ipads were transfered and we ended switching my mother in law plan over too. She was so pleased and was shocked of the service she received. With our previous carrier tmobile they were dismissive and rude. We noticed a big difference in the way Xfinity handled our questions verse tmobile. I am proud to be part of the Xfinity family and will recommend other families to switch. Ali should be recognized for his service and knowledge. Congrats Ali you deserve it 👏,5,25-Jan,1302

Xfinity #1302 Morton Grove,Store Experience | Staff | Manager Complaints,"Dated review from June 2024 experience…. it took 3 separate store visits to upgrade my phone.

While my grievances are primarily with the staff at this location bless Monica David and the staff at the table troubleshooting tech issues, they are patient and charismatic individuals.

I met with Waseem on my first and second visits which ironically revealed a lot about his character and unwillingness to provide standard customer service.

I walked in trying to upgrade my phone. I had an appointment and was seen. Waseem informed me that I was not an authorized user on the account I share with my mom and therefore he would have to stop the conversation and ask me to leave. I explained to him that my mom would be unable to come to the store to sort out the issue because she is disabled and does not drive, and that I had been paying for the services and managing the account since 2021. Nevertheless he ushered me out and did not explain how to resolve the issue for me to be able to upgrade my phone or change my authorization.

I called Xfinity afterward and was able to add myself as an authorized user and checked in for my appointment. Waseem again. He said “Sorry still no” and when I questioned him from what I understood was the reason he was unable to talk to me last time he says
“I didn’t tell you any of that I didn’t have permission to talk to you” Frustratedly I ask him to write out on a piece of paper to me what I would need to do to upgrade my phone
and he writes “Mom needs to be present” and I was like can you write down what the option there is for my mom not coming and he takes back the paper and goes “or Primary on the account”. At some point during this interaction his manager walks out, I forgot his name but he has glasses, chewing on a bag of chips and walks up to us and is explained the situation. I did explain there that I believe I was not being treated respectfully and that his team member blantantly lied to me and I am on my 2nd visit and yet again not able to buy a phone.

The last time I went in I had met with Monica and experienced no issues. I had made myself primary on the account and she was able to help me upgrade my phone. She was patient while I worked out some plan and specific phone details with my mom on the phone. She showed me where on the app I could access and redeem in-store coupons that I had no idea about.

I do not leave reviews but felt compelled to even so much later because these specific people are to be remembered and either requested to work with or completely avoid if possible.",2,25-Jan,1302
Xfinity #1303 Merrillville,Store Experience | Long Wait Time,Xfinity is more concerned with have mobile service that if you go in to turn in or exchange cable equipment you have to wait ours or leave and mail it in.

Xfinity #1303 Merrillville,Store Experience | Staff | Behaviour Issues,"I was a victim of fraud someone pretending to be Comcast called me Who has access to my personal information through Xfinity. I went into the Comcast office and was told that Comcast never ever call anybody. They reach out through email and I was naïve and basically left that. I was told they were going to give me the number to the fraud department only to get the one 800 Comcast number where I had to wait for another 20 minutes to speak with an operator and another 10 minutes before I got to the fraud department through billing. Since then I have received over 20 phone calls from people at Comcast, which is funny because I was explicitly told that they don’t do that. Comcast has the worst customer service out of any company that I have ever experienced in the last 40 years.

Xfinity #1304 Bolingbrook,Store Experience | Staff | Manager Complaints,"I've had good service a few times at the store. However this last time.  Devon who took 20 minutes before taking a customer while there is a room full of people who have been sitting there over 30 minutes.  He's not the friendliest, which eh I'm not looking for Merry Poppins, but geez the attitude and demeanor of our conversation. He really needs improvement dealing with customers, but per him he's been there for 11 years, so that must mean he's a superstar.  A little nicer approach, I would have been fine with the outcome situation.  Then he offered to get the manager, I said sure.  He grabs his stuff, rolls his eyes and goes to the back.  Of course the manager is busy, per se.  He said there is nothing the manager could do for me. its company policy.  I could deal with the policy but the arrogance and trying to be intimidating is what the issue turned into.    I told him to he needed to work on his customer service.  He didn't like that.  All of this could have been avoided, if when I checked in the employee could have said it's past the 30 day's you can't return, and Devon wasn't standoffish.  I  asked a few question's, and responses were given like he doesn't have time.   I would have accepted it's company policy , instead I sat there 45 minutes and watched the manager walk out, and numerous people walk out of the back room.  Not one could help assist people who are waiting.  When you go in the store they scam you back into a contract for 2 years.  It's gotten to expensive for their services.   Devon  may do a good job at work , but lacks personality and basic customer service attributes that you should have while dealing with customers.",1,25-Mar,1304

Xfinity #1305 Oak Brook,Store Experience | Staff | Behaviour Issues,"I'm a senior up in age, and I visited Xfinity on March 10th.  When I checked in, I told the young man at the front desk that I needed to use the restroom.
I sat down and waited patiently for a while.  But I noticed the young  man never came back and addressed the situation.
So I went back to let him know I needed to use the restroom again.  He told me I could go next door.  Because  their were too busy with customers and there was no one to unlock the door for me to use the restroom.
I told him I paid my money to Xfinity. Why should I have to go next door. He never considered that maybe I couldn't make it next door after sitting and waiting too  long to use the restroom.
There was a male customer standing in line to check in. He overheard the conversation.  So I asked him if he would mind if the young man opened the door for me.
He told then young man to take care of the senoir.  He finally opened the door for me to use the restroom. I said to him, ""How would you like it if someone  treated your mother like that.
There were 3 male employees  in the back where the restroom  was located. They all joined in on me behind closed doors and took the young man side and told me lady don't  take it personal.
Who are they to tell me what is personal.  If I need to use the restroom that is personal to me and the conversation  was between myself and the young man, which makes it personal  between us.
The young man was arrogant, and he was very disrespectful. He replied with (sarcasm) that my mother would choose other options.  It was his tone of his voice and dismeanor. He was arrogant.
I  asked a store employee  for a corporate telephone number.  He  told me he was the store manager.. He explained  that the young man could not leave the checkout desk because  customers would be roaming around.
I understand  that, but what the employees did not understand or take into consideration that I am a customer too and I'm up in age. They don't know what my medical condition is.
So hypothetical thinking say I fell or fainted would I get immediate help or would I have to wait until an Xfinity employee  was available to assist me because their all are too busy with other customers.
It doesn't take that long to unlock a door.  There is always someone  in that break room whenever  I had to use the restroom in the past.
In my opinion, Xfinity makes enough money to have a restroom for the customers. So we don't have to wait for an employee to open the door to use the restroom when they're too busy. Make it make sense
to me.  Xfinity upset me that day, and my blood pressure  went up. That was unacceptable how I was treated.",2,25-Feb,1305

Xfinity #1308 East Peoria,Store Experience | Customer Dissatisfaction,Not giving the store 1 star but the whole company I had apt schedule for tomorrow between 3 and 5 for some one to come check my box or my cables but they canceled it with out my permission after I confirmed the apt 3 times. After I spent 3 hours on the phone trying to talk to someone real because my box shut off 20x a day where I have to restart it 20x a day because either the connection is bad or the box is bad. Now I've spent a hour fighting with the robot to finally get to a real person who can't give me the same apt instead put me on a waiting list and schedule me for the 20th now very disappointed and if this doesn't get resolved I'll be 😡 this is the worse Internet IV ever have and if u really wanna make ur customer happy and this review to come down then fix my problem or I'll let my nabor and everyone here no how shitty your service is and we will find better internet may cost more but at less it's real people.,1,25-Jan,1308

Private company employee is wearing full cop-style riot gear with weapons and a recording device, and takes down your personal information such as drivers license and address. Completely unnecessary show of force, especially after dark, and $170 to remove the boot. I'm not sure how much of a cut Xfinity takes. Now I'm worried about identity theft.

Xfinity #1321 Arlington Heights,Store Experience | Staff | Manager Complaints,"Fiasco and the lazy manager is what I call the ongoing disaster that has been my recent experiences at the Arlington Heights, IL store.

I went in to this store for the first time in January to secure a new 2-year agreement for my cable and internet service. While dealing with one of their reps, I surprisingly discovered that Xfinity has a home phone plan that would save me a lot of money per month. Sounded good. Unfortunately, I needed a transfer pin from AT&T to complete the porting of our phone line.

A few days later I returned with the transfer pin to complete the deal. But the deal that I was offered mysteriously disappeared and would now cost $10/month more. I wasn’t too pleased with that and left.

However, while looking at the Xfinity site a day or so later, I saw an even better deal available to me at my address. So, I contacted my rep and asked him to help me with the transfer so I wouldn’t lose my phone number. It turned out that he didn’t know how to process that deal and showed it to his manager. His manager, with the offer clearly on the Xfinity website, told the rep the offer doesn’t exist.

Over the next few days, I communicated back and forth with my rep asking him how an offer on the Xfinity website supposedly doesn’t exist. I sent him another screenshot of the offer. He kept speaking to the same manager, and the manager kept insisting the offer didn’t exist. He actually told the rep to tell me to just call Xfinity. Do you believe that? A manager at Xfinity isn’t going to help a Xfinity customer of over 30 years. Really???

So, I made an appointment and went back in to the store. I was fortunate that another manager was on duty at the time. He took one quick look at the deal on the website, acknowledged it, and helped the rep sign me up. And I completed the verification process while in the store. I was told it would take a few days. And so, I left and waited for the porting to be completed. That same day I received a confirmation from Xfinity. I was at stage 2 of 4 to be activated at the price I agreed to. I was told I’d be notified once activation was complete.  And so, I waited. And waited. And continue to now wait for 2 weeks and the porting still hasn’t been activated.

As the days passed, I got another email from Xfinity that showed instead of progressing to stage 3 of 4, I now went back to stage 1. I’ve been in consistent contact with my rep at the store. But unfortunately, his lazy manager still refuses to help.

I finally called AT&T to see if they had any information regarding the delay. I was told that Xfinity sent in a request to port my number that same day I signed up. It was electronically approved immediately by AT&T. But I was also told the porting has just sat in limbo because Xfinity never followed through to complete the process.

In the meantime, my rep at Xfinity is telling me that my account now shows the phone line active. I keep telling him it’s not. I tried it. I still have AT&T. Am I now being charged by 2 phone companies for 1 phone line? I better not be. I even sent the rep a screenshot of a Xfinity support site that details the porting process. When the porting is complete, my existing service will automatically disconnect.

I opened the latest email from my rep who told me he spoke to his manager again about the problem with my line not being activated yet. Instead of the manager actually trying to help, he told the rep to just tell me to call support and deal with it myself. Or pay for a tech to come out.

Why the heck would I pay for a tech? It’s a process glitch. What an ignorant suggestion. So, now I’m supposed to be responsible for troubleshooting the disfunction that is Xfinity? I’ll be escalating this issue to upper management. Hello Mr. Karinshak.

Over 30 years with Comcast/Xfinity and this is how they treat their customers. And a perfect example is a manager who displays indifference, as opposed to solving the problem. It’s little wonder they have such a poor customer service rating. And in the meantime, much like this porting glitch, I’m stuck here in limbo.",1,25-Feb,1321

Xfinity #1322 Gurnee,Store Experience | Staff | Dissatisfaction,"I have dealt with multiple team members at this Xfinity store many of times throughout my 10 years of living in Gurnee and I have never had a bad experience. I am saddened to see their score at a 2.5 but my advice to everyone that will be visiting this location, or any business for that fact is the following.
In a world where can choose to be anything we want to be, we need to choose to be kind and patient with every human being we come into contact with here on earth. Many of times, some things just may be out of a persons immediate control or security clearance and they may need help from someone else who may or may not be available at the drop of our hat's. Some things may require more time and other outside of the store resources to get the issue at hand resolved as well. We are all human beings and the same way we would want to be treated with grace, patience and respect, we need to teach and remind ourselves to extend the same grace, respect and patience unto others that are trying to do their best to help us
Like I have already mentioned before, I have never had a bad experience at this location. Maybe it's because I simply choose to understand that we cant always get what we want, when we want it all the time and I fully understand that some issues in life may take more time and resources to get them solved. I give this location 5 stars out of 5 stars.",5,25-Jan,1322

Xfinity #1325 Norridge,Store Experience | Long Wait Time,They can’t even hire enough people to help the customers lining up at the door every morning. They are all liars and tell you one price and when the bill comes it is totally different. They don’t care because they know you’ll have to wait another 1.5hrs at the store before you can even see an associate. They keep jacking up prices and lie about their internet speed. They make you pay for a regional sports fee when chicago sports channels are no longer available. These people are crooks and they know it. I’m out. YouTube TV here I come.,1,25-Feb,1325

I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT AT ALL. And they do not have staff that speak Spanish.

Xfinity #1327 Normal,Store Experience | Not Recommended,Would not recommend this company. I had the same experience as Tabby a review below. A rep didn’t do their job correctly and I have a charge in an old account that I have been trying to get this figured out over 90 days now with countless ticker numbers and escalations and no resolution in site. I have called and chatted in but it’s all been a complete waste.,1,25-Mar,1327

Xfinity #1327 Normal,Store Experience | Staff | Behaviour Issues,"I have been with Xfinity for 13 years.  I went to the store after realizing that all the promos were discontinued without even letting me know. In the store I talked to two guys. The first one took my phone number and then turned me to another one, who again wanted my phone number. After that he said I am lucky to have the plan that I have and that they can’t do anything expect even increase the charges on my account or make my internet slower if that’s all I can afford. I am not sure how they can assume what I can afford or not? Aking to be competitive in pricing is not same as not being able to afford something. Either Xfinity will give my promos back or I will take my business elsewhere. You have time till April 5.  After that, I will be moving my business elsewhere. ALSO TRAIN YOUR PEOPLE TO TALK POLITELY.

Xfinity #1328 Bloomingdale,Store Experience | Long Wait Time,"The gentleman Gil absolutely ignored me once I walked in the store.  An older Caucasian man walked in and he ran and greeted him.  Then I jumped up to the front to get checked in and Gil didn’t even acknowledge the fact that he skipped me.  (Xfinity if you want reassurance please check camera from 1/28/25 around 2:30pm-3:45p.m). First red flag.

Then after I got called up, the gentleman tells me that I have to pay an extra $10 per month for my plan.  I explained to him that I just signed up for this new plan and that was not what was explained at the time.   He made me talk to customer service and they assured me that I didn’t have to pay the extra amount.  Lack of knowledge or training given to the reps by their leaders.

After having to deal with this, Jasmine the manager said I had to wait till she was done with her customer before she can take care of me.  Mind you I’ve all ready been here over an hour, and now I have to wait because their employee misinformed me?

Nobody once acknowledged the fact that they were wrong. With frustration I asked Gil why he skipped me and he said “man get out my face, I’m calling the cops.”  I was embarrassed and treated like a criminal.

This whole incident has been escalated to xfinity and they have been beyond helpful with the matter.   They have even given a fair compensation.

What I noticed from my experience at this particular (Bloomingdale xfinity) is that it caters to the older Caucasian community so they can upsell them.  If they know they can’t make money off of you, you’re treated with zero respect.

Please stop the racism and please educate your reps on what it is that xfinity actually signed customers up for.  Teach employees to look at the history and notes.  If Jasmine  doesn’t want to train the employees, xfinity do better in finding better suited managers.",1,25-Feb,1328
Xfinity #1328 Bloomingdale,Store Experience | Long Wait Time,"This store is not currently run by people who care if you want internet. I’ve been to this store 4 times in the past 5 years. Every representative I’ve spoken to is very apathetic. No one has any sense of urgency. None of them care that you’ve struggled with Xfinity or have any enthusiasm in their tone. Everyone seems to be just “doing their job.” Which I mean, I get it. It’s a job. But everyone is so monotone and so bland. They only have 3 representatives on a Saturday. That is no way to run a business with 90 min wait times. The most 2 recent times I’ve been in here, they weren’t able to help me or make any progress with my problems. It’s a total of 4 hours that I’ll never get back. An absolute waste of time. If you have to go to an Xfinity store, choose any other location!",1,25-Mar,1328

Xfinity #1328 Bloomingdale,Store Experience | Staff | Manager Complaints,Absolutely the worst experience!  Brian the “manager “ was so unprofessional.  I was lied to by a representative on the phone so I went into the store for guidance and clarification.  Brian approached me with arms crossed and a what seems to be the problem all while looking around in complete disinterest.  He proceeded to tell me that the Xfinity people we call can tell us whatever just to get us off the phone but in the store they tell us the truth and basically I will be charged a restock fee for a product I was lied to about by their representative.  As a company this is not how to treat customers let alone a new one.  He should most definitely not be a manager.  I don’t know how Xfinity allows this.  I just wanted what the Xfinity representative said I was getting.  Also these calls are being recorded!!  Great then listen to what your rep said!!  I will be recording the conversations from now on.,1,25-Jan,1328

I contacted customer service on many occasions for that (and other issues as well) and I still had to pay the fee. During the chats with them online, they'd constantly switch chat Agents to avoid speaking with me and always gave me the same responses to avoid solving the issue.

Got me signed up for a new iPhone 16 Pro Max with a trade in on my iPhone 13 of $1000. Turns out I only got $287 for trade in because I switched my number with the new phone number and the extra line I needed went away (which they said would happen but not to worry). So no $1000 rebate and I’m stuck paying $49 a month for 2 years for a phone I was supposed to pay $8 a month for. Can’t trust what they tell you in the store!

She was personable, kind and empathetic, all while being efficient. I was shocked to learn she's only been with the company two months. She's absolutely an asset and the team must feel lucky to have her.

I've also had the pleasure of working with Tom and he was also diligent and informative. Overall, this team is full of competent, capable and hard-working people. The service provided at this store has encouraged me to continue doing business with Xfinity now and in the future.

We had previously spoke with customer service (who has collections team at their disposal) instructed us on how to separate my account from the address I no longer live at.

I’m a Gold customer, never had a late payment in YEARS and due to a system error I can’t upgrade any devices on my account.

Xfinity #1507 Naples North,Store Experience | Staff | Behaviour Issues,"Xfinity Complaint – Review
I am writing to provide a summary of my very recent experience (January 25, 2025) at the Xfinity store located at 10600 Tamiami Trail in Naples, Florida.  As a Military Veteran, and former Police Detective, I have spent my entire adult life serving and protecting the public (citizens).  The last thing I need is to visit the aforementioned Tamiami Trail Xfinity location to be treated poorly by some cocky young man I would not even allow polish my boots as he would fail miserably.
To begin, I was not having a great day, which was made significantly worse by this young man's poor behavior and customer service. He was rude, disrespectful, and uncompromising. Additionally, he was wearing sunglasses in the store which was dimly lit to start with to again demonstrate his arrogance. This young, insignificant and annoying pissant was extremely difficult to deal with and basically put up a big stink because I was asking him some questions about Xfinity’s available services. Ergo, if I buy Xfinity's services, they can afford to hire people, such as this arrogant young man.
Unfortunately, this arrogant pissant was more concerned about a commission and entertaining his colleague rather than answering my generic questions about Xfinity’s service offerings and pricing. He and Xfinity (formerly Comcast) obviously do not value good customer service, if this young man is an example of their public facing staff. He failed to meet my simple needs and / or expectations, which will now adversely affect Xfinity’s reputation, client base and overall profit. As noted, he was rude and impolite which resulted in an abrupt and unsympathetic interaction.
If Xfinity is operating bricks and mortal locations, then customer service and the behaviors of its representatives can and should enhance the instore experience, or alternately, as in my case be extremely detrimental to Xfinity’s reputation.  Please note that reviews (good or bad) play a major role in Xfinity customers’ buying decisions. As in my case, Xfinity’s representative failed to maintain a friendly, empathetic tone, and even went so far as to be demeaning and placating.
In summary, I now associate Xfinity with bad customer service and will be taking my telecom service to one of Xfinity’s competitors. There are presently 20 plus telecoms providing services in the Naples Florida area (area code 34104).  When you narrow the 20 plus to the top 7 Service Providers, Xfinity ranks third behind Quantum Fiber and CenturyLink. Based on review of their respective web sites, I can sign up for better and more cost-effective service from either of these two providers.
Thus, I will be dropping my over-priced Xfinity TV / Internet service and signing up with either Quantum Fiber or CenturyLink within the next week or two. To all those reading this review, please support a former Military Vet / Police Detective who was poorly treated after my many years of public service. I strongly encourage you to voice your concerns and / or issues with Xfinity and their staff, and support me in my decision to move your telecom service elsewhere.

Xfinity Complaint Update January 28, 2025
Xfinity responded to my comment with a standard off the shelf response that firstly did not address my concern in any way.  Secondly, it forces me to contact them. Shame on Xfinity. Show some respect and genuine concern by contacting me using my email address.
FACT: the telecom sector is highly competitive requiring provision of top-notch customer service to survive and differentiate the large number of providers. Provision of top-notch customer service requires more than just a policy, but a company wide culture. However, Xfinity seems lost on this integral component of business operations, which their off the shelf, AI generated response simply emphasizes. Provision of top-notch customer service results in retention of customers (i.e., customer loyalty). I have terminated my Xfinity contract, and hope you do the same. WE must stand together to make BIG TELECOM responsible and accountable.",1,25-Feb,1507

Xfinity #1510 Plantation,Store Experience | Staff | Manager Complaints,"My husband and I went to this store for years. We had changed my phone to a Samsung almost 2 years ago. My phone broke and we have insurance coverage, when coming to the store we were told the phone was not showing with the same phone number and we were also paying insurance for both my old and new phone. My new phone was never properly set up with my number and my old iPhone still showed up with my current phone number. The manager just kept repeating the same thing over and over again about what was showing in the system instead of suggesting what should be done to correct an error that was made years ago on our account which resulted in us paying insurance for a phone that is not even active and my current phone. Even though the insurance plan covers a replacement he kept insisting on a repair instead, he charged us extra to expedite the new phone and we still have not received it when we were told it would arrive Saturday 2/15/25. We tried calling his phone on the business card he gave us for the past few days and it goes straight to VM which is full and one cannot leave a message. He called my husband today and hung up, my husband recognized the number from his business card, his name is Kevin Brown and it seems like they are running a scam. Initially, he told my husband we could not dispute the charges on the phone not being used either for the insurance that it was too long already and then he changed and said he was going to place a dispute himself in the system. This guy ghosted us, we did not receive the phone and he will not answer our calls.",1,25-Feb,1510

Xfinity #1511 Miami - West Flagler,Store Experience | Long Wait Time,"(Translated by Google) I must first point out that Alexis resolved my situation in two minutes. After a wait of an hour and a half. The customer service system they use is truly very slow and inefficient. It is unheard of that each person's wait is more than an hour. This simply shows an inefficient system of customer service and resolution of needs. It is not logical that manager Victor and the staff take this as normal. Showing users that they do not care about the time they have to wait because that is how Xfinity customer service works. Frustrating. Since I was only going to pick up a modem for delivery, I was on a call with the operator for 54 minutes before arriving at the store.

No es lógico q el manager Victor y el personal lo tomen como normal. Demostrando a los usuarios q no les importa el tiempo q tengan q esperar porque así funciona la atención de Xfinity. Frustrante.

People not caring or being kept ignorant about these issues is why hacking and phine fraud is out of control. I went to the other xfinity store and things are fine there.",1,25-Mar,1512

I thank them for all the attention provided at the place but the truth is I could not get what I was looking for.

I went into the store after talking to people on the phone because I was told three different things from three different people they really need to have a big meeting and put everybody on the same page. Anyhow, I went into the store and I asked the lady when they take your name for the way to please let me speak to somebody who is a manager for my issue. Of course when I'm in my name did get called I did not get a managerial position person I got a young woman. I asked her about my streaming and if there's something I could do about it or what my options were and her answering me was I don't know. Well that doesn't answer my questions cuz well I don't know. So then I had to ask for a manager. A manager did come I asked him a couple questions he was very short very abrupt and obviously acting like he didn't have time for me or my questions. I have been an Xfinity customer for over 20 years and I've been in the store a few times there was a manager that was there all the time that was wonderful did not see him and I'm not there that often but I did not recognize any of the people and usually I see the same people.

Xfinity #1521 Miami,Store Experience | Long Wait Time,"After waiting an hour or so for Xfinity to call me back so I could cancel my internet service (can’t cancel online of course, that’d be too easy), I then waited nearly an hour in the store just to simply drop off their router. To top it off, the employee I had to wait and speak with before I could drop off the router had the audacity to lecture me about canceling my service (after my monthly cost tripled post-expiration of a sign up promotion), rather than just asking them for another promotion (which supposedly they would’ve given me had I asked, though of course they never said how much of a promotion and for how long). It seems Xfinity’s business strategy is to lure customers in with short-lived promotional pricing, then triple the price of their service after they’ve hopefully forgotten about it, but offer those select customers who do complain another short-lived promotion to try and keep them locked-in. That’s more akin to the way a drug dealer behaves than a good business. Even if there weren’t significantly cheaper and better options available, I’d never use Xfinity again on principle alone. But luckily it’s 2025 so there’s plenty of competition. Can’t wait to tap dance on the grave of this business when it finally goes bankrupt in another 10-20 years.",1,25-Jan,1521

Xfinity #1525 Palm Beach Gardens,Store Experience | Long Wait Time,"I recently visited the Xfinity store at Palm Beach Gardens to pick up new equipment for my recent contract, and the experience couldn’t have been worse. The store was severely understaffed, with only two or three employees trying to handle a crowd of customers. The wait times were ridiculous—I spent almost an hour just to pick up equipment!

Ben, the person who introduced himself as the manager, was unprepared and rude. When we complained about the wait time, he failed to manage the situation and only made things worse!

If something as simple as a pickup takes this long, I can only imagine what’s ahead in terms of service and support. This was an unbelievably frustrating welcome to Xfinity, and I already regret signing up. They need to seriously improve their customer service and staffing levels. My advice: Don’t come to this store, and think twice before signing up with Xfinity.",1,25-Mar,1525

This is the second experience with this store and the manager that is excruciatingly bad. The last time we came in to have a phone upgraded. Easy, right?  Nope. They upgraded the wrong line on the wrong phone and instead upgraded our daughter’s phone who happened to be traveling solo, stranding her without a phone.

So I called spent about an hour talking to the first woman who wouldn't give me her name and then finally I figured out all I needed to do ( I figured this out not the woman who is supposed to know what to do) I need the password to my email that they created and I've never used. So I'm transferred and after this lady asks me the same million questions waste another half hour of my time tells me there's nothing she can do and she sees nothing after she just told me and confirmed that she could see my account in the background...

The wait time is incredibly long – it took almost 50 minutes to even get a rep. The staff at the front should be better trained to know what can and can’t be handled in-store. Instead of wasting my time, the phone number I was given at the end could’ve been provided from the start. Several customers ended up leaving, and those who politely asked about the wait were met with attitude. I also saw one employee spend over 40 minutes flirting with a customer instead of working, and even after being spoken to by a manager, the conversation continued for another 15 minutes.

Dear, Xfinity Customer Service,

I am writing to express my disappointment regarding my recent experience at your store.

While I acknowledge that she completed the task of transferring my phone number from one device to another, her behavior during the interaction was unprofessional and disrespectful.

First, she addressed my fiancée as “mami,” which I found highly inappropriate and unprofessional. Additionally, she was wearing sunglasses indoors and chewing gum while assisting us. This demeanor made me feel that there was a lack of respect towards both myself and my fiancée.

I appreciate that the task was completed, but I expected a higher level of professionalism and respect from your staff. I hope that this feedback will help improve customer service in the future.

Sincerely,
Maksym.",3,25-Jan,1532

I was having trouble with my service on February 3rd, 2025 and after spending hours being switched around to a ""remote"" helper (which didn't work) and trying to speak with a ""live"" person, I eventually had to go to the Service Center in Leesburg, FL. to get my issues resolved. I was frustrated that I had to drive that far from home and then to see the amount of people waiting to be served. My turn to speak to a Retail Sales Consultant, brought me to the desk of KRISTEENA H.  I told her what my issues were and how I felt of having to drive that far to this store. She remained calm and listened to my concerns. The more time that passed as I sat at her desk, I realized that his lady truly cared and was totally there to resolved my issues... which she did. I had to take the time to write a review for the impeccable customer service that she gave to me. Xfinity -Comcast needs to realize the gem of an associate that they have in Miss Kristeena H.

It would be pathetic for a technology company to have to do that, but it would be 1000 times better than their current system.",1,25-Mar,1537

Xfinity #1538 Jacksonville,Store Experience | Not Recommended,"When I first visited Xfinity, I was assisted by a representative named Ada. Unfortunately, her customer service was lacking, and she showed little empathy. As I tried to explain my situation, she gave me a dismissive attitude, making it clear that she wasn’t concerned. I would not recommend her to anyone. I escalated the issue to the manager for assistance, but he also displayed a dismissive attitude. He didn’t offer any apology for his employee’s behavior. I felt frustrated and annoyed with their customer service and approach, as it was completely unacceptable. However, Josh Price turned my experience around. He provided the excellent customer service I should have received from the start, and really made my day better.

Not only did he get my internet cost lowered from $55/month to $45 /month BUT he got me their mobile unlimited plan for free for the first year on top of a free phone upgrade.

Almost sounds too good to be true, but the new phone (Galaxy A16) has been great, and I've double checked my billing statements. It's all true. I believe once my free year is up on mobile it'll be $40/month, which is still not bad at all.

But the moment you call them out, they band together like a low budget team of superheroes.

I went in to the store because Xfinity customer service is deplorable. Good luck getting a live person on phone or chat/text or a person in the States. They lie then try to trick you into paying for service calls. Yesterday they offered me a FREE iPad that wild only cost me $149 today and 36 per month. This to be paid as bill credits. Bllsht. It ain't free. When the service works it is amazing. But you'd come closer to Winning a Grammy with a karaoke and than getting even mediocre customer service from Xfinity.

The inside store service wasn't much better. Hey dis 'Merca! We don't respect nobody.

Xfinity #1710 Flint,Store Experience | Staff | Dissatisfaction,"Worst business to work with. 1. Xfinity has a block on the house we close on next week. We are NEW would-be customers. I work remotely from home and my husband owns several businesses he also runs from home. We need Internet and cable connected the day we close (Friday). 2. We have wasted hours online and on the phone trying to work this out and it's not even our problem, it's between Xfinity and the FORMER customer. 3. We decided to drive the 20 minutes to the Miller Rd store to attempt to resolve this and when we walked in the store was quiet with 20+ people waiting, a handful of employees with customers and several standing around. Every single person saw us walk in. ZERO greeted us, nobody said hey stand in line at the desk over there to check in etc. Nothing. Not a smile, not acknowledging we hadn't been helped in any way, nothing. 4. We watched people be helped before us that arrived after us, so we stood in line behind them and were eventually assisted by a young man named Cameron. He told us we could make an appointment or wait 2 hours to speak to a specialist (the people standing around not helping anyone). We explained our situation and he did his best to middle man but the specialist told him they would not do anything until we brought the DEED to them. On the house we don't close on for another week. Because Xfinity has a situation with a FORMER customer. Then we find out that is just so they can send it to collections. Has nothing to do with us or our soon to be home. But because they placed a fraud block, we are being jerked around with honestly, the least business like behavior I've encountered anywhere, ever, from their webpage to the phone calls to the in person disinterested unhelpful interactions. 5. We cannot contact the former owner or their realtor legally. This is a dispute between Xfinity and former customer and Xfinity has done more to prevent us from signing up with their company than anything. They have done nothing proactively to gain us as customers. 6. We have done our homework and found that many people in identical situations followed TO-THE-LETTER what they were told needed to be done, with payments, deeds, proof of past and current residency, etc. just to wait MONTHS for the block to be removed and a new connection made or for some others to find out Xfinity still wouldn't remove the block. 7. There aren't any other highspeed internet providers for the area we are buying our home. 8. Xfinity may lose our business, $15k or so over the next 10 years, over a $250 bill and fraud block on a former customer they've already written off. The former owner has sent a check by phone for the past due amount in full (he's in a different country at the moment) and that can take 10 days to clear. Xfinity will not do anything until it clears and again has not been the least bit helpful in any of this. 9. We have every right to be angry, and we are. 10.

Xfinity #1711 Bloomington,Store Experience | Customer Dissatisfaction,Comcast is about worthless had service installed in my new place that we just moved to and they didn't bury the cable a month later I call them about burying the cable was told they would do it in 24 to 48 hrs I told them I had work that was going to need to be done so it needs to be done asap but was fine with the time frame the next week still not buried called back and they said a ticket was never made and it would be another 24 to 48 before they could bury it again I told them this is holding up work that needs to get done and it needs to be done asap just after the 48 hrs mark a guy shows up to my house and tells my wife that it won't be till April before they can bury the 6 ft section of cable cause of a weather hold cause we had a bad winter I live in Indiana it's 2025 and we did not have a bad winter it's currently March and the ground has been soft for a while now I DO NOT RECOMMEND Comcast they have a hard enough time answering their phone and talking to you let alone coming out and actually doing their job and doing it right now I will say the guy who installed our service in the new house was nice polite and did a really good job and even kept his promise and came back out later with more materials to finish the job that he didn't have on him and helped out only thing he didn't do was bury the cable of the rest of Comcast could be like him they might be a decent company but it should not be this dang hard to have a 6 ft section of cable put underground I've advised Comcast not to come back out to do the work if they can't do it for a month I'll be burying the cable myself tomorrow idk why we even pay for their service if they can't even service their own equipment nothing but a dang joke if it wasn't for my wife being the one that pays this account I'd drop them like a bad habit and never look back I hope and pray their company goes under so we have to find a different provider my wife doesn't want to switch cause she likes the prices and all and since that's her account that up to her but they ain't worth $1 specially when I have to finish their job and I'll put my name just Incase this post comes up annonomus or something my name is Brandon Hiday,1,25-Mar,1711
Xfinity #1711 Bloomington,Store Experience | Long Wait Time,This location must have a sign outside that attracts only the most incompetent sales team possible.

Xfinity #1712 Granger,Store Experience | Customer Dissatisfaction,First off you can’t call the store. The only number you get is customer service and their automated system doesn’t allow you to call if you just have a general question. You have to either be making a payment or buying something. Secondly I had this service 3 years ago and when I cancelled and returned my equipment they said I’m all good and paid up. 3 years later I get a call from a collection company saying I owe them money? No prior calls emails or letters from there telling me this information. DO NOT go on a contract with them if anything do prepaid services. Now I have to go back years in my bank statement to prove it was paid because obviously they messed up and won’t take responsibility for this mess up. Ridiculous,1,25-Feb,1712

Xfinity #1716 Lansing,Store Experience | Customer Dissatisfaction,"Don’t expect store employees to be sympathetic to your problems or be in sync with their customer service reps.

I tried to return equipment at this store after being directed to by their online customer service rep. Was told in-store that they couldn’t return them and I’d need to call customer service back (they did not offer to help in any way while I was in the store).

Called the corporate line they gave me and was told again that I needed to return them in-store. When I went back to the store a few days later, they magically had a way to return them, but too bad it was now past the 30-day return window.

So not only was I lied to the first time I went in, I was responsible for calling customer service (for the 3rd time) while I was in the store to get a resolution, their associate at the store refused to call. I can’t believe that one company can be so dysfunctional. As soon as another company provides internet service in my area, I will be leaving Comcast permanently.",1,25-Feb,1716

Xfinity #1724 Grandville,Store Experience | Staff | Manager Complaints,"I’ve never dealt with more incompetent rude customer service in my life.  First trip I told them I needed another box for wireless TV so I could have both of my TVs wireless.   He gave me a box with two coax connections. I went home, plugged it in the same way as my other wireless box and it did not work. After some research I found out it Does not supply wireless signal to my TV. I went back in to the store and the greeter who was more concerned about watching videos on his phone told me it was the correct box. I went home for a second time plugged it back in and called customer support for Xfinity.  They told me it was not the correct box. On my third trip in I told the greeter I needed to talk to a manager. After waiting, I was sent to a regular customer service person. I told him I needed to talk to a manager and he told me I couldn’t talk to the manager until he tried to help me first.  I told him he has now tried and he can’t help me because my request was to talk to a manager.   At this point I had to make a small seen because he was condescending and talking down to me as if I was in the wrong for requesting to talk to a manager. When the manager finally came out, I explained my entire story to him and he started giving me attitude telling me I was wrong. He was telling me that I could not have two wireless boxes on my TV. I asked him why did the customer service reps that I called tell me I could. He could not explain to me if two WIRELESS boxes of work or why they wouldn’t work. He was also trying to put the blame on me for the situation. At one point he told me it was my fault because I did not come into the store first. When in all truth, I did come into the store first because I was never shipped the equipment that the phone Support promised.  I also said to him at one point that he would be as upset as I am if this had happened to him. His response was “no I wouldn’t because I would’ve come into the store first”. Through the entire process there was zero explanation, communication or concern to listen to what the customer actually wanted.  I explained to two employees what equipment I had and what I wanted to do. Only until I made a scene in the store Thank you did anybody take the time to try to explain to me why they gave me the equipment they did and that there is a chance that I could not do what the Xfinity phone Support told me I could do. And even at that point, they couldn’t tell me why.

Update:

The equipment customer phone support and the Internet told me I needed works.

This is the equipment the store failed to give me on my first 2 trips and begrudgingly gave me when I told them I wanted to try it.

The four employees I dealt with were rude, and blamed me for them giving me equipment that didn’t work.",1,25-Jan,1724

Xfinity #1731 Fort Wayne,Store Experience | Customer Dissatisfaction,I had a service tech appointment and the guy showed up and sat in his van right outside my door for 5 minutes then just left. Never came to my door. I literally could not call anyone about this cuz they only have automated services. So I had to drive all the way to the store to complain. Trust me when I say they didn't seem to care in the least. Instead they asked if I flagged down the driver... now why would I be flagging down the driver? It's not my responsibility to go knock on his door of his van. Maybe they are confused on how customer service works. So now I have to sit at home and wait 3 more hours for the next tech to show up.

Tried calling as was assured when I signed contract would be that rate for 2 years and was on hold for 55 minutes with help center telling me managers were all busy and unable to take my call. It has been my experience that when you call for help or questions it is not unusual to be kept on hold so long you hang up. Now I need to make a trip of 45 minutes to get to the store to talk to someone who may or may not be able to help me. So frustrating!

Xfinity #2106 Frederick,Store Experience | Staff | Behaviour Issues,"I highly recommend avoiding this store if you ever need assistance, as it was nothing less than a nightmare.
I am beyond appalled by the treatment my parents and I received at this Comcast location. Drove an hour to get help with a billing issue on our account. I had proof that my account was being charged incorrectly, simply trying to resolve an issue and seek assistance.

Instead of receiving any kind of support, a woman working at the store completely dismissed my concerns and, in a shocking and completely inappropriate move, accused my parents of being racist and harassing her. This is not only completely unfounded but incredibly offensive, especially given that my parents are of color themselves. It’s absolutely unacceptable for someone to respond in such an inflammatory and unprofessional manner when customers are simply trying to get help.

This incident is a clear example of poor customer service and a lack of professionalism. To be treated this way – after driving so far, with clear proof of the issue they were addressing – is completely unacceptable. It’s especially distressing that such a statement was made during a time when racial sensitivity should be prioritized, not weaponized. My family and I will not stand for this behavior, and will be escalating this to corporate.

Comcast, you should take this seriously and address the behavior of your staff. This experience has been nothing short of humiliating, and it’s left my parents feeling harassed and disrespected.",1,25-Feb,2106

Xfinity #2111 Baltimore,Store Experience | Customer Appreciation,It's nice to be able to have a physical store to go into to troubleshoot your cell phone service.

Xfinity #2111 Baltimore,Store Experience | Not Recommended,"I bought a new cable modem and all I needed was to get it registered. I spent way too much time on chat and voice calls with customer service who had no idea what they were doing. Probably the 13th person I talked to suggested I go into a store. (First person who didn't just cold-transfer me off.) I went into this store and they had no problem registering my modem in about 5 minutes (including waiting in line).

I tried calling the store number to say thank you, but it's just the national 1-800 number. I'm glad there are still real stores with real people who have real knowledge. I can't do anything about the Comcast monopoly on Baltimore but I can at least try to get the rating of this store up.

Xfinity #2130 Baltimore,Store Experience | Customer Dissatisfaction,"I recently had the pleasure of working with Darrell “Jake” Anderson at the Xfinity store in Canton, Baltimore, and I cannot say enough about his outstanding level of professionalism, knowledge, and dedication to customer satisfaction.

Initially, I visited the store to switch my home internet service, and Jake made the entire process seamless. He took the time to explain all available plans, helped me choose the best option based on my needs, and ensured I understood every step of the transition. His patience and expertise were truly commendable.

However, what truly set Jake apart was his ability to turn around a previous negative experience I had at another Xfinity store in Towson. When I first switched from AT&T to Xfinity Mobile, I encountered several issues that left me frustrated and regretting my decision. The Towson store provided poor service, and I felt lost in the process. Fortunately, I decided to return to Jake at the Canton store, and that was the best decision I could have made.

Jake immediately took ownership of the situation. He carefully reviewed my account, identified the problems, and personally reached out to Xfinity’s customer service on my behalf. He was persistent, professional, and incredibly thorough—going above and beyond to ensure that all my issues were resolved. Within a short time, everything was fixed, and I was finally able to enjoy the benefits of my Xfinity Mobile service without any hassle.

It is rare to come across someone as dedicated and customer-focused as Jake. His commitment to ensuring a smooth and stress-free experience is truly commendable. Thanks to him, I not only have a great home internet setup but also a fully functional and cost-effective mobile service that meets all my needs.

If you’re considering switching to Xfinity for internet or mobile services, I highly recommend visiting the Canton store and asking for Jake. He is the gold standard of customer service—knowledgeable, patient, and truly committed to helping customers. Thank you, Jake, for your incredible support and for turning my experience into a positive one!",5,25-Feb,2130

Xfinity #2320 Deptford,Store Experience | Customer Dissatisfaction,"I canceled my cable after only six days of having it because during that six day period, I was forced to go to the store four times and even called customer service once and my issue still wasn’t resolved. There were far too many red flags during that six day period, for me to remain a customer. On top of that, when you visit the store, they act like you OWE them your business! Even the management provides horrible customer service. Side note: I also discovered that after using my email address with XFinity that I started to receive all kinds of solicitations from other companies and to the extreme! I absolutely HATE this company with a passion and signed up with Verizon Fios. Absolutely ZERO complains with them but you also get what you pay for. My advice? Spend the extra bucks with Verizon and you’ll have an easier life and better customer experience. Lastly, XFinity failed to refund me my guaranteed money back installment fee (if services were cancelled within 30 days) of $25. They just kept the money.",1,25-Mar,2320

Xfinity #2322 Jersey City,Store Experience | Staff | Manager Complaints,"Back in late August, I went to the store asking for Internet and phone service. The employees gave me the price for both the phone and Internet. I asked the employees wrote down in the paper and signed his name and texted them for evidence the price they promised me. Then the bill came in October, the price is higher than they offered me. I texted the employee he assured me from the second month my bill would be low as the first month they charge installation fee. Then again in Nov, December, the bills were not changed. I contacted the employee who promised me he would make the change for me, but in January again the bill was higher, he said he would take a look, but then he disappeared, I waited 2 weeks, he never responded so I went to the store talking to the manager explained and showed her all the text messages that the employee kept promising me my bill would be low. The manager said they gave me false information and they don't work there anymore (I am not sure) , it's impossible they offered me that price, it's wrong. I said your employee represent your company, your company trained them so it's your company's responsibility, I didn't make the assumption, it's your employees offered me. The male employee were there back in September confirmed me the offer but now threatened to call police on me. I said please call the police. They didn't train the employees correctly to give customer correct information, if the employees gave customers false information the company should responsible for the mistake. I will report to the company.",1,25-Jan,2322

I've reached out to her several times to try to solve this issue but to no avail, first she said I had to wait 3-4 months (I did), then she said that she would have to escalate it to her boss and I would hear back from them (I didn't).

The store manager Shaun Wilson checked up on me and my family to see how we were doing. He made us feel comfortable and well cared for. He took it upon himself to help us directly. What we came in for seemed like it would be complicated, but he made the process seem easy. He made us laugh and engaged us in interesting conversation. At the end of our visit, we were in awe of Shaun. All Xfinity employees should strive to be more like Shaun in everything they do. Please thank him for his service. Please give him a raise. His customer service skills will keep a person like me coming back for more. This is how businesses thrive, not just with good deals but with good personalities.

Xfinity #2326 Newark,Store Experience | Staff | Dissatisfaction,"I came here to get help with a problem with my billing on a seasonal property we own. I was told that the store didn’t handle seasonal convenience plan policies and that I’d have to use the virtual store assistant.

The set up is awful!  I’m speaking with a person with a heavy accent. And as if it’s not hard enough to understand him, the acoustics on speaker they have installed is horrible!  Oh, not to mention the background noise on both ends of the call!  I spoke to a store employee about it and they said they knew it was bad but there was nothing they could do about it. I suggested perhaps a headset and they said it wasn’t set up for that. No one checked to see how I was making out.

At one point I was asked to get a store agent. It wasn’t hard to find one that wasn’t busy. He came over and it seemed he was having difficulty hearing/understanding as well. Ultimately he was asked to send a copy of the seasonal convenience plan we’d been sent acknowledging that it would begin  Nov. 8, 2024. For whatever reason, the problem couldn’t be resolved by the virtual assistant and was turned over to the store agent who said some unkind things about the virtual assistant just not wanting to do it. The store assistant seems very bothered by having to take over in this.

Luckily a lovely woman Amanda, maybe the manager??, came over and said she would get the issue resolved. I look forward to that happening and if it does, I will gladly update my review of the store’s service, but not the virtual assistant set-up!",1,25-Feb,2326
Xfinity #2326 Newark,Store Experience | Staff | Dissatisfaction,The Xfinity store at Christiana mall has some awesome people working there. They start with greeting every person that walks in the store and make sure they assign someone to work with you. I had a terrbile experience with support over the phone. Looks like the folks on the phone are very aggressive in terms of sales pressure and lack a basic undertanding of customer service and lack the knowledge and bungled up my order and they were unwilling to cancel the order. Shout out to Nick Bolgar and Alexandria Santamaria who went through extra efforts and fixed the issue and took time to understand and worked with tech support to fix the issue and we walked out happy customers.,5,25-Feb,2326

Xfinity #2331 Philadelphia,Store Experience | Not Recommended,"Let me tell you why I'm giving this place 1 star. Long story short I had two phones activated on my account which I never gave authorization for any phones at all. The only reason why it happened is because the person shares the same name as me. And that person wasn't even getting the phones for themselves they were getting them for someone else under their account so they can make sure that their phones are paid for each month. But that's not about the store when I'm giving the store one store for mainly is because how could you even let that happen?
Why don't you check people's last four of their social or actually make sure it's the right person so that's what kind of place you're dealing with. And I found all this out today as I got alerts and when I tried to tell the lady that she said she did not want to get into my personal business. I said it is my personal business because it's coming up on my phone and it's in my account. Just telling you about the store itself.

Xfinity #2334 East Brunswick,Store Experience | Staff | Dissatisfaction,"Exceptional Customer Service Experience at Comcast – A Shining Example of Excellence

I recently visited Comcast to add a new line to my account, and I must say, the experience exceeded all expectations, thanks to the outstanding service provided by Jason. From the moment I walked in, Jason demonstrated unparalleled professionalism, product expertise, and a customer-first mindset that made the entire process seamless and efficient.

What stood out most was Jason’s deep knowledge of Comcast’s product offerings and service capabilities. He not only guided me through the best options tailored to my needs but also took the time to explain the features and benefits in a way that was both clear and insightful. His ability to simplify complex details while ensuring I understood the full scope of the service left a lasting impression.

Beyond his technical expertise, Jason possesses extraordinary people skills and a natural ability to build relationships. He was engaging, personable, and genuinely invested in making sure I had a positive experience. His approach wasn’t just transactional—it was built on trust, rapport, and a commitment to long-term customer satisfaction. His ability to connect with customers and make them feel valued is what sets him apart as a true asset to Comcast.

Jason exemplifies Comcast’s commitment to customer satisfaction, operational excellence, and brand integrity. His approach was proactive, solution-driven, and infused with a genuine desire to enhance the customer experience. His ownership mentality and attention to detail made me assume he was the store manager—a testament to his leadership qualities and dedication to delivering best-in-class service.

Comcast emphasizes a customer-centric culture, and Jason is a prime example of that mission in action. He turned what could have been a routine service transaction into an experience that felt personalized, efficient, and truly valued. I left feeling confident in my decision, knowing that I had been guided by someone who takes pride in representing Comcast with integrity and service excellence.

I highly recommend recognizing Jason for his exemplary customer engagement, product mastery, and unwavering dedication.

Once I realized they gave me the wrong phone, they told me I had to come back another day to exchange it. Luckily they sold my fiance the correct phone, but rather than helping him, the guy ran away and started helping someone else. I think he was sick of us at that point lol. Added another hour to our stay. It gets better. My fiance went back the next day to get this resolved and there was so many people waiting and he was told it might be an hour EVEN THOUGH HE HAD AN APPOINTMENT. And they were closing an hour later. So he had to make ANOTHER appointment for the next day! I went in the next day and the guys there, Nick, Mike, and Steve took care of the issue with no issue and were very pleasant, entertaining, and all around good dudes to hang with while i spent another 3 hours there. I had fun. Left very happy and grateful. If you MUST go here, pack a meal and plenty of fluids because it will take hours.",3,25-Mar,2335

The representative was rude right from the start. I told him I didn't know the specifics maybe he could find the answers through my account info. He paused and said ""Hold on, I have to go to the bathroom."" And walked off. He came back after a few minutes, hands me my phone and says it would be activated in a few.  That was  unnecessary sir.  You didn't have to waste my time for no reason. I even gave you a $6 tip for your help. You really need to find another job and work on your attitude bud. Good luck in society.",2,25-Feb,2335

Xfinity #2445 Orleans,Store Experience | Customer Dissatisfaction,"I am extremely impressed with Sam, (Locust Road office Orleans, MA) who spent a serious chunk of her time explaining Xfinity services to me...a 72 year old.  She not only showed me how I could be saving a lot of money by switching our family's mobile phones from Verizon, but then...she actually handled the switching over herself, explaining every step along the way to me...a techno challenged adult.  Her patience, kindness, and help were reminiscent of shopping experiences from days long ago.  I had been to AAA earlier that day and was shocked by the coldness and lack of customer service at the Dennis, MA AAA.
Not only did Sam make a very difficult task pleasant, but she also found me a wonderful deal on a mobile phone watch, which is already making my husband with Parkinson's disease much safer.  Thank you Sam and thank you Xfinity for having such a wonderful employee.",5,25-Jan,2445

This is by far the worst phone service provider I have ever dealt with.it has been almost a year and they haven’t fixed the issue I am dealing because of this store associate and manager.
They haven’t fixed the massive mistake they made giving access to my account and adding phone lines to the person who gave them the same address as I have-WITHOUT MY CONSENT
This is the blatant violation of customer security and privacy.
The store manager was beyond unprofessional who tried to cover his associates for this incident and expected me to fix this because they have access to my account to the person who lives in the same building-completely useless customer service and zero solution.
This company and this location store is a complete Disaster-negligent,untrustworthy and totally incompetent.

Xfinity #2522 Somerville,Store Experience | Staff | Behaviour Issues,"Today at 1:30 PM, I went to the store and spoke with a girl there about canceling my Xfinity service and starting a new one because my bills have been inconsistent and overly expensive each month. She told me that I needed to bring back the equipment I currently have at home first. I explained that I wanted to start the new service and return the equipment afterward, but she insisted that I bring it first. Even my own friend did the same things before. She was extremely rude and dismissive, making me feel belittled. Additionally, I spoke with the manager before this location is pretty close to my house, and he was just the same things, rude, and unpolite. This location is pretty close to my apartment and have a Lotta parking only reason why I went back.

I’ve also noticed that many times when I come to this location, the staff—often  are either unhelpful or outright rude. Their attitude makes me feel like I want to disappear when they talk to me. I’ve even felt discriminated against, especially because of my limited English. On one occasion, someone even told me to ""go away,"" which was incredibly hurtful.",1,25-Mar,2522

They can’t even bother to send a personalized response for each situation or apologize for their staff and incompetence. Seriously, that’s just insult to injury after wasting three hours of my time with no resolution. DO NOT enroll in Xfinity services of any kind. Go to Verizon or use Hulu.

Don’t go here if you have an actual problem. The employees are rude and impatient. They’re not trained to competently do their job and will tell you to just call customer service. I spent three hours on a Saturday in the store, using the live agent chat, and on the phone. My issue was still not resolved. It was a very simple problem too. it is impossible to speak directly to an actual person. Glad I ditched Xfinity. I am never coming back. Don’t use this provider. I hope they don’t reuse the equipment. When you return modem and cable boxes they just throw it in a bin which could damage it.

Xfinity #2709 Greensburg,Store Experience | Staff | Manager Complaints,"I was having many issues with Verizon sending me my final bill since I changed carriers to Xfinity and qualified for their promotional rebate.  I went to the Xfinity store in Greensburg, PA and spoke to a Manager and Tommy.  Tommy advised me to go to the Verizon Corporate store also located in Greensburg and speak to a Manager. I had already been there that same day but did not ask to speak to a Manager. I returned again. Spoke to a Manager and received a final copy of my bill.
Tommy then helped me to navigate uploading it into their system to start the rebate process.  I HIGHLY suggest switching carriers to Xfinity and asking to speak with Tommy if you visit the store.  I was a Verizon customer for 15 years. NEVER AGAIN.  Tommy has GREAT customer service!!!! 😊",5,25-Feb,2709

Xfinity #2713 East Liberty - Pittsburgh,Store Experience | Staff | Behaviour Issues,"Avoid this place at all costs!!!! The staff here are rude and completely unhelpful, making my experience as bad as it could get. Because of them, I decided to switch to Verizon and never came back to Xfinity!! Even though I had an appointment, I was asked to sit elsewhere for no apparent reason for at least 15 mins, but I wasn’t too bothered with it. The worst part is the ridiculously rude girl I got when I have questions about a plan.

I came in to start my internet service with some information provided by my apartment including their recommended/preferred plans. However, as soon as I mentioned this, the staff member’s attitude changed. She seemed very annoyed that I didn’t pick the plan she suggested and even gave me wrong information. I then asked about a $10 plan that was provided in my apartment wifi information. She claimed that it’s for a one-day pass but in reality, it’s for 30 days stated in xfinity website.

Rather than helping me, she told me to move to another seat while I tried to figure things out on my own. I expected to get assistance, but instead I was left with no useful information and cold attitudes. To top it all off, when I asked for further assistance and how to verify plan information, she just disappeared for a moment and returned to tell me there was no phone number or any assistance I could contact for help. A complete waste of a wonderful afternoon. This kind of service is exactly how you lose customers. I’m now switched to Verizon, where they actually value their customers and provide proper service. I would give negative stars if I have the option…",1,25-Jan,2713

Xfinity #2716 Triadelphia,Store Experience | Staff | Behaviour Issues,"You should educate your sales team at the store better. I wish I could remember his name. It first started with me saying the Unlimited Plan will not work for me because it only offers 3G data speeds for hotspot. It was the second thing listed in the flyer but he kept claim ""only after you have used up your 30gb of data."" Please notice the image I attached from your website. The second bullet point. It is only 3G data speed for hotspot unless you upgrade to the Plus.

Another thing that bothered me about him was the idea of blaming everyone else for a problem. From ""You must not have an unlock phone"" to ""Well, you bought it from Best Buy so that's your problem"" to when I cornered him on the fact that it was an Unlocked Samsung S24, he proceeded to blame the Xfinity tech support team by saying ""I am always cleaning up their messes.""

He seemed to be very unprofessional. Its someone else's fault. There was never, a ""hey, when you are in the area, why don't you bring your wife's phone and lets see if we can't get it to work."" or other helpful suggestions.

I asked her and then told her to leave the conversation but she refused. I f you can go to any store besides this one , I would advise you do so. Hopefully this store will stop getting customers and will close. I’m sure Comcast doesn’t care because they have a monopoly in most areas.

Xfinity #3106 Santa Rosa,Store Experience | Long Wait Time,"So far I have had the absolute worst experience with Xfinity’s customer service at the Santa Rosa location. The assistant store manager Paige Fitts was very rude to us and has wasted our time every time my wife and I have gone in, since she has no desire to help their customers resolve an issue. We have now been in the store 3 times for the same problem, and had to wait 2 hours each time, just to be told there is nothing they can do for us. We traded in our old iPhones in October right after the new iPhone 16 came out. It is now January and we have an email confirmation that they have received the trade in phones back in October, a week after we sent them in. Three months later we are still getting charged $55 per phone for my wife and I. They say we just have to wait for them to process the trade in phones while they charge us $55 each per phone per month. They also “accidentally” were overcharging us an extra $20 on one of the phone lines for 3 months. This company over charges their customers and has no remorse about it. I was only supposed to be paying $75 a month for two lines and are instead getting charged $190 a month for the past three months. They have no desire to “process” our old phones because they get to charge us every month for our new phones when we shouldn’t have to pay for that, which is what they told us when we first signed up.",1,25-Jan,3106
Xfinity #3106 Santa Rosa,Store Experience | Long Wait Time,The female rep who helped gave me great service and quickly resolved my issue.

Xfinity #3106 Santa Rosa,Store Experience | Staff | Manager Complaints,Second time I have come to store-made an appointment-still had to wait !!! Asked if I could PLEASE use the ladies room-they said no because they have important information stored in the back. Secret files!!! The manager was very snippy and said he was going to ask me to leave. I told him I am just looking for someone to explain my bill to me. The person he gave me to was a very young Hispanic girl-it was her first day-I asked her to please help me by giving me a copy of my bill-she rolled her eyes and did a tisk sound. On this experience alone I will be changing companies. Even though you are a service based company you still need customer service-I was not the only person in the store who was having trouble with the employees-I asked the manager for his card and he just disappeared into the back! I pay on the average of $210 per month-I guess that doesn’t include ANY customer service !!!! I got zero satisfaction from the 2 visits I made to this store. If you want to be treated poorly by young  people with BAD attitudes-go ahead !!!!,1,25-Feb,3106

I call on the phone for an hour and a half. The lady was nice but she couldn’t help me. She tried everything in her power so I go down to the store they were even worse, helpless, even the manager fooled with it and had me put new passcodes in Three or four times not running him on paper. I was so discouraged and he couldn’t figure it out why I wasn’t getting my emails or my outgoing so I go back in my car and I called the one 800 number again and that poor man helped me as best as he could well I’ll behold early in the morning. I got my emails to work in my incoming, but the outgoing was it. I went down there tonight. There was only two people. They were rude. They could say I was crying that was upset because I’ve been overwhelmed with this issue and I can’t figure out a life in me why these people are trained better I’m a good customer 3040 years with you guys and they can’t help me with an email problem it keeps saying either a wrong passcode or the wrong user number and it’s not it’s not wrong.

Xfinity #3131 Daly City,Store Experience | Staff | Dissatisfaction,"There seems to be a complete disconnect between Xfinity Comcast’s online sales team and their in-store staff, particularly at the Xfinity Serramonte location. I visited today to pick up a modem for internet and streaming services after completing my transaction online. However, the experience was incredibly disappointing.

The sales associates—a Middle Eastern-looking woman and a man—were shockingly hostile. When I informed them that I had already handled everything online and was simply there to pick up my modem, the man abruptly told me to step away from the counter after I mentioned that I hadn’t been informed of any additional charges. They refused to connect with the online sales team or even offer me a detailed explanation just because my transaction was processed online, and it seemed like they were unhappy about not securing the sale themselves.

The service was appalling, but thankfully, I quickly switched to AT&T’s fiber optic service instead. The customer service at Xfinity Comcast (Serramonte Mall)  was disgraceful, and I hope management takes action by hiring staff who are professional, customer-focused, and willing to assist all customers equally—regardless of race.
The guy told me to step away from the counter so he could attend to walk in customers as if online customers were not a priority.

On January 24, they set up a new address for me and assured me that my Internet was already working. When I came home, my Internet did not work. In addition, I tried to contact through a personal online assistant, but he could not even find my address. I had to come to the office on January 25. I stood in line for 1 hour and 30 minutes, because I missed everyone who had an online appointment. I could have made one too, but I found out about it after 1 hour.

Xfinity #3135 San Jose,Store Experience | Staff | Manager Complaints,"Avoid this place like the plague. If I could give it minus stars, I would. They have horrible customer service and I see why given the behavior of David Rodriquez, their manager.  They do not care about people's time. They do not care about giving you good service. My experience was horrible from start to finish, where they treated me like subhuman. I walked into the door and the first employee waved me off to go video chat with somebody over a screen that kept disconnecting. It disconnected three times while we were troubleshooting my issue. They  in store didn't offer any apology. They in store didn't offer to help. They just abandoned me for two hours despite me driving there. After two hours, I walk up to one of the employees and request that one of them finally helps me. I am polite despite how much they wasted my time and they start to give me an attitude. He starts to say,’ oh, why are you so frustrated? M And they make you seem crazy like their customer service isn't below the bar. I mean, one of the employees was supposed to be chatting with the customer support on the PC. And he was browsing his phone and on social media right in front of my face and I watched him for 5 minutes. I almost took a video of it. It was ridiculous. When I called him out on this, the manager had the gall to say, oh, he's waiting for a response. And I questioned the manager and said, ‘what do you mean he's waiting for a response? Are you supposed to be on the phone when you're with a customer? ‘Then he said ‘no. ‘ I tried to be as respectful as possible, giving the situation. I ended up spending four hours in the store. They are rude. They are unprofessional. They don't know what they're doing. They don’t have skills to do their job. I don't know why they're there. Xfinity needs to take a look at this store, at David Rodriguez and at Chris. And every single employee of this store failed me today. Every single one.",1,25-Jan,3135

Xfinity #3138 Yuba City,Store Experience | Staff | Manager Complaints,"1 star for clean environment, 1 star for some good helpful staff.
I decided to change my number but the agent ""Serena"", she is the second time acting none professional and weird, she does according her wish not according customer needs.
She decided to call her manager on me, the manager was kinda of help but him still was acting none professional as ""Serena"" was doing.
Even I was offering method that manager can do help but he was refusing and ignoring, manager told me I'll call security, I said go ahead and I'll call cops.
The manager gave a number to call the xfinity mobile but that number did not work after I tried many times.
Finally after offering by me many types of help that manager could do, then somehow he was able to do unwillingly, other then manager was totally refusing to help me thu I told him many times I need your help.
I was calling over 3 hours to have my previous number, but couldn’t get help.
“Serena” the agent needs to be trained or she should change her job.
Totally 4 hours my time wasted cause of none professional customer service of Xfinity mobile.
I was deciding to add 1 more number but they made me feel regretting.
I appreciate the manager at least he said “sorry” but the agent she never.
I’m sorry! I can’t recommend more than 30%.",2,25-Mar,3138

Xfinity #3141 Folsom,Store Experience | Customer Dissatisfaction,"Extremely Poor Service at Xfinity Store - Folsom

I have been an Xfinity customer for nearly 20 years, primarily because they were the only high-speed internet provider available in Camino. That has changed with Starlink, and after my recent experiences at the Xfinity Store in Folsom, I am seriously questioning why I continue to give this company my business.

I have visited this store three times in the past two months, and each visit has been worse than the last. In December 2024, I attempted to sign up for Xfinity Mobile based on an offer. At the time I was a AT&T customer, but they have also become too expensive. The service at Xfinity Store - Folsom was so unhelpful that I ultimately left without completing the transaction. In early January, I returned to adjust my elderly mother’s account. As she is on a fixed income, I carry her account on my own at a dual address service. She wanted some adjustments so that brought me to Xfinity Store - Folsom once again. I wanted to do this with a in-house employee to apply for Internet Essentials for my mother. Although, I pay for her account, her fixed income is the cause and I think she'd qualify. Unfortunately, I never found my answer. After waiting over two hours, I watched multiple employees—including the manager—sitting at the counter joking around, completely ignoring customers. Frustrated, I left and completed the transaction online.

Still, I gave them one more chance. On January 23, 2024, I returned for something incredibly simple, dropping off an old modem/router from my mother’s service adjustments. Once again, I was pushed aside and made to wait. For 50 minutes, I watched the same scenario play out: employees laughing, joking, and socializing with the manager instead of helping customers. I even recorded the situation on my phone (still AT&T) because it was so ridiculous. While I considered posting the video as a warning to others, I hesitated due to legal concerns about recording non-employees in a private business. In total, I counted approximately 6 employees, 2 of whom were working and the rest were kicking it with the manager lady.

This is completely unacceptable. Customers should not be forced to wait for hours while employees stand around doing nothing. The lack of professionalism and customer service at the Folsom store is staggering. I pay far too much, covering both my own and my mother’s Xfinity accounts, to be treated like an afterthought.

At this point, I am giving Xfinity one last chance. If I experience one more incident like this, I will cancel both my mother’s and my own service. It’s disappointing to see a once-reliable company decline like this, but if the Xfinity Store in Folsom is any indication, they seem eager to accelerate their own downfall through sheer incompetence and indifference toward paying customers.",1,25-Feb,3141
Xfinity #3141 Folsom,Store Experience | Not Recommended,"I went in with my mother to get her service set up. Her house is on my lot with another home, for a total of three homes. We are told that because the address isn't listed in their system they had to ""check"" if it could be serviced. Fair. But the attitude and disrespect we have received in what will be a month long process does not bode well.

Neither the in-store nor phone customer service could provide me with the PIN number.

I even tried using their app to get the PIN number, but it didn’t help. The store manager, Zulaikha Campbell, never stepped out to assist or speak with me, even after an hour of waiting. Extremely disappointing customer service.

Ms. Pacheco and Poko helped me to solve my bills problem in just 1 visit.

For the last couple of months, I reached out to different telephone agents and online Xfinity assistant numerous times to try to fix my bills problem which some incompetent online agent caused when moving my service to my new apartment unit. They put incorrect service and plan to my bill, which I expected to be an easy fix. But, again these online agents are just not capable.

However, when I went to the store at 5611 Pacific Ave Unit 100, Stockton, Mr Poko took the initiative to help me to look at the root of the problem and referred me to the manager. They solved the problem swiftly.

Xfinity #3351 Albuquerque,Store Experience | Customer Dissatisfaction,"Try not to come here it is the worst place on earth just to simply return some old crappy modem that they charge you a service a month even though is not in use and it iis absolete. Takes 1 hour when they should have 2 or 3 cues depenging on what it is one is doing. Just for that i will cancel xfinity.
N then if you dont get confirmation for your equipment you returned they charge you full price.
This place is horrible. Try to avoid it if you can. Unless you wanna waste your time sitting down in shitty stools.",1,25-Jan,3351

Xfinity #3352 Lakewood,Store Experience | Customer Dissatisfaction,I wish I could give this place negative stars. First and foremost their service is overpriced and unreliable. When you do go to cancel play turn it into an hour-long process and try to sell you all kinds of stuff that you don't want. Avoid this company at all costs.,1,25-Mar,3352
Xfinity #3352 Lakewood,Store Experience | Customer Dissatisfaction,"If I could give zero stars I would. I signed up for home internet and phone service through Xfinity and had some questions about my new service and was unable to get through to customer service. I went into the store at 7400 W Alaska dr in Lakewood and was met with nothing but disrespect. The store was a complete mess. The employees were standing around talking with each other, and when I asked the gentleman in the front of the store a couple of basic questions about Xfinity, the manager, Alfredo Ochoa, approached me very confrontationally, and told me he would take care of me. He was extremely disrespectful and dismissive. He then started getting very close to me and puffing up his chest. I came into the store because the customer service number won’t let you talk to a live person, and the Alfred Ochoa started squaring up with me… I was completely blown away and so was every single person in the store. He then told me that I was being a girl about the situation and if I didn’t like it, I could leave. Is this how Xfinity treats its customers? I am completely appalled by the disrespect from this entire store. If I was his general manager, he would be fired immediately. It is a terrible look for Xfinity to have this disgrace of an employee be the face of their business. I wish nothing but the worst for him and that store. There are other really great stores, though, and the one in wheat Ridge has amazing customer service! Hansel at the wheat Ridge location is a phenomenal employee! He has incredible patience and knows how to de-escalate a situation. Unlike Alfred Ochoa, who is a pathetic coward.",1,25-Jan,3352

Xfinity #3352 Lakewood,Store Experience | Long Wait Time,"Gave my name at the front desk to be put in the queue. Waited over an hour, check on my status and they never put my name on this list. They apologized, put my name in, I waited another 45 minutes after being told I would be “bumped up”. Another 45 minutes of waiting, check in again and they said I was 6th in line. 3-4 employees hanging out at the front desk, chatting… while techs in the back were taking care of all the people who came in much after I.
Really?
I gave up and left",1,25-Mar,3352
Xfinity #3352 Lakewood,Store Experience | Long Wait Time,I can't even describe how much of a miserable multi-hour process this has been. They have made so many mistakes that cost me time on the phone. Now they sent me an extra router by mistake that I didn't ask for and at making me drive an hour and wait 30 minutes in line because they won't just take it at the front counter. What a stressful waste of my life this has been. No wonder everyone hates Xfinity,1,25-Mar,3352

Xfinity #3352 Lakewood,Store Experience | Staff | Behaviour Issues,"These guys are still in the dark ages with their ""contracts"". Nobody is doing a year contract (well, less and less are). I switched to Quantum Fiber and there are no ""contracts"". I have to pay a charge for quitting my service with Comcast. They will learn sooner or later that they can't bully the consumer anymore. Provide a fair service at a fair price is all I ask.
Hopefully will never have to go back to Comcast. Customer service is HORRIBLE.  Most of the actual humans that you finally get to talk to have terrible English with such heavy accents, I can't understand them anyway.
Good riddance Comcast!!!",1,25-Jan,3352
Xfinity #3353 Colorado Springs,Store Experience | Customer Dissatisfaction,"If you call their ""Service"" phone number after putting up with lots of dumb stuff from their crappy automated system you might get someone human to talk to. I got someone ""human"" to talk to but she was a low talker and mumbled so you could barely understand her, Shauna, I believe she was intentionally aggravating in a way she knew she could get away with, not at all helpful and I think she enjoyed that. So you have to take time out of your day and drive down to their goddamn store like Xfinity thinks their customers are their employees. they jack the prices up every year because they can but why are the prices 50-100 dollars more for the same service other cable companies in town charge? Because Xfinity is a greedy crappy company run by greedy crappy people. I'm calling Quantum tomorrow.",1,25-Jan,3353

Brandon did not want to help just said everyone is going up. I left not very happy with his customer service skills",1,25-Mar,3353
Xfinity #3353 Colorado Springs,Store Experience | Long Wait Time,"This goes out to xfinity in general. Stores are over an hour wait every time. How is this acceptable? We returned a phone but contunue to be rebilled for it monthly $695.  Our phones were turned off because of it We were sold on the storm ready being told that we could use it on the go in the van. Doesn't work and even the new rep. said that it not what it is for.  Now waiting for 1.5 hours to try and return it...ha! The bills do not include a breakdown of the charges.  Just heard a lady say she has been here 4 hours waiting!
My friend had the same experience with his phone he returned. They claimed they didn't get it and monthly charged his account, he'd have to call up, have it reversed and then charged again.

Xfinity #3357 Centennial,Store Experience | Staff | Manager Complaints,"Xfinity Store Nightmare: 8222 S Yosemite St Suite A Customer Service Disaster (1 Star)

My experience with this Xfinity store location was an absolute nightmare of poor customer service and blatant disregard for customer concerns. After discovering I was being billed for two years for a cable box I never received, I sought resolution from the store manager. Instead of help, I encountered stonewalling, dismissiveness, and outright hostility.

The manager David refused to listen and investigate to my legitimate complaint about fraudulent charges, offering only a pittance of a resolution - a mere $100 off could only go back 90 days of service. When I returned with documentation proving the billing error, the manager became even more obstinate, refusing to review any evidence, blocking me from speaking with other staff, and essentially telling me to leave.

The level of unprofessionalism was shocking. Not only was I charged for equipment I never received, but the store management demonstrated zero commitment to resolving the issue or providing basic customer service. The manager's behavior was confrontational and unhelpful, making it clear that customer satisfaction was the absolute last priority.

This experience represents everything wrong with modern customer service: a complete lack of empathy, no willingness to investigate errors, and a corporate attitude that treats customers as inconveniences rather than valued clients.

The very helpful third party Xfinity personnel at the Aurora store was able to find the problem without a solution because it was a third party and was very empathetic and understood my situation.

""Following, TV box box ending in 9328, 5910 was added the SAME day 1/03/2023. To me, it looks like adding a primary tv box was how the representative was able to activate your A/O cable card. Your cable card is an Cable card, which must have a primary box to provision in Our CSG tool, to activate the
equipment.

This information was given to me
By the third party representative at Xfinity in Aurora unfortunately it was not reviewed by the manager David to understand why I was charged this email is evidence that there was a mistake done on their part.
Hoping that this situation will be resolved as soon as possible",1,25-Feb,3357

They refused to help me with a product they sell!  that was from the manager and a tech,  I guess they don't want to help some customers, like old ladies.  even ones who are computer savvy.  shame on them for profiling me and my gray hair.  they don't deserve a star but you can't do a review without one.  so, I'd vote 0 stars. and apparently they are the sole support in Pueblo!  I did check.",1,25-Feb,3362
Xfinity #3364 Colorado Springs Barnes Marketplace,Store Experience | Long Wait Time,"I went in today to get help with switching some equipment and get some questions answered. The person who did help me was great, no complaints with that.

Aside from the bills going up up up with no help with that, which sucks. I pay more and don't get more, I usually get less. So that's great.

But I think what's frustrating for everyone waiting in the store is having 6 employees working, in the area of customer visibility and only 2 helping people. 3 employees were just sitting chatting it up at the desk behind the big tv, doing absolutely nothing. I kept looking at one guy like come out and help people but nope, he just kept sitting there doing nothing. So why have more people working if no work is getting done? Makes no sense.

I may get a response to this, but it'll be some basic response and that's it, no help with bills or fixing customer service.",1,25-Mar,3364

Continually spoke over me, kept trying to sell me another service when I was just transferring a phone number to a new account.

Xfinity #3365 Aurora,Store Experience | Staff | Behaviour Issues,"I recently had one of the most disappointing experiences with your customer service team. Unfortunately, my interaction with a “Retail Sales Executive” named Dimitri Sommer was particularly unpleasant. From the moment I approached him, it was clear that his demeanor was unprofessional and dismissive.
I found it incredibly difficult to ask any questions or seek assistance without being interrupted or redirected in an unhelpful and dismissive manner. His approach to customer service was not only unaccommodating but also disrespectful, leaving me feeling unheard and frustrated.
As a customer, I expect professionalism, patience, and a willingness to assist, especially when seeking guidance or clarification. Unfortunately, this interaction fell far short of those expectations. It’s disappointing to encounter such behavior from a representative of your company, as it reflects poorly on the overall customer service experience.
I sincerely hope this feedback will prompt a review of your team’s training and performance standards to ensure that future customers are treated with the respect and support they deserve.",1,25-Jan,3365
Xfinity #3365 Aurora,Store Experience | Staff | Behaviour Issues,"Wow, I am not sure why they even bother making appointments when they are not interested in assisting customers. The agent (Hakeem) was very rude and unhelpful and told me to call the 800 for assistance and then declared the appointment was completed. Then he canceled my appointment.

To the store replying to my concern: You just slap the same generic canned reply on each and every review. Be responsible and take ownership instead of a disingenuous reply.",1,25-Mar,3365
Xfinity #3365 Aurora,Store Experience | Staff | Dissatisfaction,"It's almost like Xfinity does not want to help customers... oh wait! They dont! Spoke to Hakeem the other day and it was the worst customer experience I've had. He kept interrupting me and did what he could to put me on the defensive. He tried to make it seem as if the issue was my own fault, simply because I told the phone agent that I wanted the promotion advertised on the Xfinity website. It is impossible to get these people see reason. I thought if I went to the store and spoke to someone in person that they would be better than the call center, but that was not the case. With very few exceptions Xfinity customer service does not want to provide a pleasant, seamless customer experience. All they care about is that you pay them money.

To the store reading the review: No need to leave a link when you reply. Xfinity chat is even worse than phone or in store service. Take ownership of the issues you caused and quit trying to blame the customer for everything.",1,25-Mar,3365

Xfinity #3372 Denver,Store Experience | Staff | Dissatisfaction,"Xfinity is really the worst company ever. They do not care at all for their customers. First of all it’s impossible to reach any human via phone call or text if you have any issues. The only way they’ll connect you to someone is if you tell AI that you want to cancel. Someone at the company opened up two accounts for me when I picked up my router. I was getting charged TWICE for one internet service. I obviously did not pay for the other account and they sent it to collections. When I called to get this settled, the person who picked up argued with me, then escalated this to a supervisor, then said I’m right and put in a ticket, and then tried to sell me some mobile plan after all of this as if I want to use them for anything else. When I move I will never use them again. This company is full of leeches.",1,25-Mar,3372

Xfinity #3373 Westminster,Store Experience | Staff | Dissatisfaction,"So far the service works. But dealing with their customer service really is something else. Chastised with demeaning comments for not responding while you are waiting on them to pose a question to respond too. It just took me exactly 1 hour (in the pics you can see conversation started at 11:40 and ended at 12:36) to set up a installment plan for a charge I was told I would not receive, but did anyways. It takes 5 to 10 minutes per message while communicating. EXCEPT when they are trying to sell you on a phone plan. Then they are majically able to send messages and respond within seconds. And they won't take no for an answer. I said ""no thanks"" 5 times before finally just asking to proceed with the request I contacted them about.

Buyer beware, Xfinity promises great speeds and great prices, but eventually overtime it gets slower and they up their prices overtime. Terrible customer service on multiple occasions, huge time wasted in troubleshooting and while trying to cancel. Even trying to drop off equipment at the local store was going to take 20 minutes.

Xfinity #3453 Orem,Store Experience | Staff | Manager Complaints,"As a loyal Xfinity customer for over 10 years, I am incredibly disappointed with my recent experience at the Orem store. I decided to switch my phone service to Xfinity because I qualified for two discounts: one for being a long-time customer and another for bringing my own phone. The customer service representative even took the model and brand of my phone, confirmed it qualified for the discount, scheduled my appointment, and assured me everything was set up so I could pick up my phone.

However, when I went into the Orem store to complete the process, I was shocked to learn that the manager said my phone was not qualified and that I would not receive a discount for it. This completely contradicted what customer service told me. I even provided the name and ID of the representative I spoke with, but the manager claimed he didn’t know who she was and told me I would need to find her and bring her in to resolve the issue.

This situation has been incredibly frustrating, unprofessional, and a complete waste of my time. I trusted Xfinity to honor their commitments, but instead, I was misled and treated like my concerns didn’t matter. Xfinity needs to fix this lack of communication and accountability.

I hope to hear from Xfinity soon and get this situation resolved. As a long-time customer, I expect better.",1,25-Jan,3453

Great music and conversations while transferring from ATT.  It took only 1.5 hours for a family of devices (7+) to be transferred to Comcast.  Melissa also helped put the numbers together to help seal the deal with the internet deal.

This experience with Comcast was a lot less time than the starting experience with ATT in Farmington three employees and a manager with seven devices, which was a terrible experience taking over eight hours, we left the store with only two devices working out of the six as they ordered apple watches for our Samsung phones which was another ordeal swapping the watches back to Samsung.

Xfinity #3456 Layton,Store Experience | Staff | Behaviour Issues,"I happen to go in when it was a little busy. They took about 5 min to even acknowledge me. Then I waited a total of 30 more min until I was helped, just to pick up a new router/gateway.

While I was waiting they had music playing on a Bluetooth speaker that was resting on one of the signs hanging from the ceiling. It was a bit loud and I had trouble hearing them talk to me, they were practically yelling at reaching across the store to communicate. I found this unprofessional.

While I was waiting a woman came in and they went to get her name. I was close enough I heard her she was just in to pick up some equipment, like I was. He told her to wait and he would grab it real quick. It didn't turn into a real quick interaction. As the store employees do he tried to upsell her on a phone plan, they were still taking about it when I left. This employee thought he could just be real quick with her but cut her to the front of the queue skipping 4 other customers that were waiting.

When it was finally my turn Felix got my info and reason I was there but before he went in the back to get the gateway he tried to upsell me on a phone plan. I promptly declined not to waste our time. He was nice and quick to get me on my way.

Why should it take 30+ min just to pick up equipment for a self install? I could have had it shipped to me but would have waited 5 or more days. They should have self service pickup and drop off lockers. I know you have phones, I don't want one from you...",2,25-Mar,3456

After waiting more than an hour just to be helped is terrible in the first place, I was there to pay my bill with cash cause that is all I have. After waiting for over an hr I'm told that they can't accept cash they only take cards and that I can go BUY a gift card visa and come back. Why in the world first would someone go pay more money just to pay a bill? I also got a watch back in December it is the most ugly color EVER and apparently it is THE ONLY COLOR THEY HAVE in store it is the galaxy 7 watch in that ugly green color. I haven't even so much as turned it on and it was supposed to be a deal $150 off of the $300 price tag making it $150 but after review of my account nope I'm being charged $348 and some change. Really?  And they won't exchange it or do anything about it any of it. I was treated very very rudely, lied to, manipulated by this company that I've remained a loyal customer to for over 15 years!

Xfinity #3551 Vancouver,Store Experience | Long Wait Time,"Xfinity itself, the brand, the tech service, the long list of broken promises and bold deceptions is one of the biggest disappointments in a service that I have ever had.  Sixteen years of fighting and struggling to get decent service until even the thought of calling them one more time made me sick to my stomach.

It’s like that horrible struggle with an addict friend who swears again and again that he will change, he will do better until the very sound of his voice gives you the creeps deep down in the very essence of your soul. And you finally just give up on him/them.

So then suddenly some kid shows up on your porch and offers you a cheaper, faster, more reliable service and it’s like hope is born on the shining morning horizon. Normally I don’t talk to these door to door people, regarding them as unwelcome locusts or a part of a hoard of garden snails waiting to be plucked from the gloom and dropped in beer.

But I listened this time and it was so sweet to call Xfinity and tell them that I could cut the rotten, fraying ties that bound us.

But why this review? And why not zero stars?
Because there at the ultimate stop,  the final handoff of hated equipment, the staff handled it with good graces and easy efficiency.

Bam! I hand them the equipment, get the printed receipt, and I’m out the door like the wind through young saplings. Never to return. That part at least went easily.

The tale of Xfinity and I could fill a novel, and a horror novel at that. I am thrilled to see them in my rear view mirror.

You would think after 15-20 tech visits and multiple complete overhauls that one of them could have fixed the problem. But you would think wrong.

I tried to talk to a supervisor and was promised I could, but no-one called me back. Then i found out no supervisor got scheduled to call me anyway.

Xfinity #3551 Vancouver,Store Experience | Staff | Dissatisfaction,"If I could give them a -10 I would, the reason they make everyone have a debit or credit card on file is because they continue to charge it even after you cancel your service for months on end until you figure it out and then trying to get your money back from them is a joke!  This has happened to me and other people that I know I even went as far as taking out my banking information in the app so they had nothing to deduct it from and they still were able to deduct it from my bank account and then the hoops they make you jump through to try to get your refund most people probably would give up because it is not that user friendly and I'm computer literate by a long shot the seniors or people that don't understand computers they would have all kinds of problems!
Mind you I was getting reminders saying that they were going to be deducting this month's payment and called their customer service and they assured me that no the account has been closed we're not going to deduct any money and they still went and deducted money 2 months in a row these people are scamming everybody we need to show them who's boss not them this is so ridiculous that they have been able to monopolize the industry for so long cuz people had no other choice let's show them who's boss there are choices out there now and that's why I no longer have them I would pay double the price just to not have to deal with their customer service and their lies!

Xfinity #3558 Gresham,Store Experience | Staff | Manager Complaints,"My wife and I came to the decision to change internet providers to save us some money. To end our membership, we had to turn in our router, and it was one of the worst experiences in customer service that I have ever witnessed. The employee who “helped” us was a manager, who as soon as he learned we were canceling our membership, turned into the biggest Cee U Next Tuesday I’ve ever had the displeasure of meeting. He was flat out rude and was short with us to the point that I really just wanted to throw the router in his face and leave.

After essentially being told to kick rocks, we were sent to the corner of the store to get help with someone through a tablet, despite multiple employees appearing to be standing around staring off into space. When the guy we spoke to on the tablet (who was nice) was done helping us we were told to collect a receipt and we could go. When we went to do this, the same manager refused to give us one, claiming they’d already taken care of it and it was “too late”.

The cell phone provided by the store is experiencing screen failures and I only recently obtained it. The store's response was that I should contact Motorola directly to address the issue. Shouldn't the responsibility for ensuring the quality of their products fall on them? The store appears to be unconcerned about the faulty phones they sell. This practice is disconcerting, and it calls into question the store's commitment to customer satisfaction",1,25-Mar,3560

I was trying to show him on my phone the error message that I was getting on my TV to what he didn’t pay attention to. He didn’t even read it. I am trying to explain myself to him, but he did not show any interest on what I was  Busy trying to clean his watch he proceeded to give me the quickest solution, but still not answering my questions. He was talking on top of me. He was not letting me explain myself. I got to the point where he said I can’t help you any further because we need to send out a technician after explaining myself to him a few times he didn’t seem to have a bit of interest on what I was saying, I ask him if there was anybody else that I can talk to and that’s when his voice changed and started talking to me in Spanish, which I didn’t appreciate because my conversation with In English, I then proceeded to tell him that I didn’t need him to talk to me in Spanish that I understood what he was saying. He then proceeded again to tell me in Spanish to go sit I asked to talk to a supervisor which he denied, and he said at this point, I am going to call the cops on you and I said call the cops on me for what he threatened me to calling the cops on me a few times just because I asked to talk to a supervisor because I felt I was not beans treat with respect, by then he had her threatened me a few times to call the cops on me. I don’t know for what reason then he went to the back of the office called a supervisor named Brandon. Were both not helpful they both make me feel threatened and when I tried to talk to the supervisor about how the employee was threatened me to call the cops. He didn’t want to hear about it. He shot me a few times and said what’s your problem? What are you here for? The service here is always bad. I feel that the people here at the store are not properly trained or they feel that because there’s not a number where we can call and put in a complaint they can treat you however they want. So I went ahead and called the cops myself, and I am filing a report against the employee I feel threat and I felt Threat And discriminated by both supervisor and employee.",1,25-Feb,3650

I visited the store to return an iPad based on instructions provided by Xfinity customer service. The agent I spoke with assured me that I could return the device by showing the ticket they created. However, upon arriving at the store, the staff rudely informed me that they could not process the return because the item was ordered online.
The employees displayed a complete lack of professionalism and empathy. One staff member outright said they had no connection with Xfinity customers, claiming they were only salespeople and ""didn’t care about customer issues."" This dismissive and arrogant attitude was incredibly frustrating, especially since Xfinity's own customer service had directed me there.
Instead of providing any assistance or even basic courtesy, the staff seemed more interested in deflecting responsibility. It’s shocking that a brand like Xfinity allows its representatives to behave so poorly and mislead customers.
I expected at least a minimum level of support and professionalism but left feeling cheated and disrespected.

Xfinity #3655 Lynnwood,Store Experience | Long Wait Time,"Sigh. I know writing this review is going to take more of my valuable time. But as a good samaritan, I feel like I should share this with everyone.

First let's do the tl;dr -
1) Uneducated, ill-mannered and inexperienced, unprofessional staff at this location.
2) Xfinity's customer service is trash beyond imagination (you'll see why)

Let's begin.

We went to the store to cancel my Xfinity Internet service. I told them that we've (my wife and I) been trying to get hold of someone since 3 days over chat and call but the agents always leave the chat or cut the call. They asked me to wait.

The wait itself was 40 mins. I now realize why it takes so much time. Slow service because of inexperience. But anyway, moving on.

One of the agents came to attend after 40 mins. I told him that we've been trying to cancel the services since 3 days but nothing happened. That's why I had to come during my office hours and cancel it in person. He said you can do it in the app.

I know you can't do it in the app so I have him the phone and asked him to do it for me. He didn't know anything. He kept scrolling through screens.

The account is under my wife's name, so he said only your wife can do it. I had my wife on the call the whole time when I was in the store. She even helped login to the app. But why would that be enough for confirmation. But anyway.

He said since I was not a ""manager"" on the account, I can't cancel the services. I was like, okay if I'm not a manager, tell me how we can do that.

He said through customer service try cancelling or see  if they request for being a manager. Since he already made me log in the app, I reached out to customer service and tried cancelling in front of him. Loading screenshots of what happened below. So that did not work out. He's now even more frustrated that Xfinity service is actually trash.

Then he goes back to his manager and comes back. He then gives me a paper with a toll free number. Says I should call this number and they will help. I show him that I've already contacted the number and either no one picks up or the call gets disconnected. He said thats not possible.

So I call the number again. It doesn't connect the first time. Second time as soon as someone picks up, and the call drops while the other person is speaking. I had put the call on speaker. So the agent sees this happening. Not knowing what to say, he tells me, wait for it, that they dropped your call because they think you're a scammer. I could not believe the sheer defensive behavior. At this point I knew that I was fighting a losing battle. I was not going to get any help here. He said go to the manager, he'll help you out.

I knew it was going to be a waste of time but I still went to the manager to express my disappointment and extreme lack of satisfaction. He proceeds to say that he can't help me. I also told him that if we wouldve been able to do this online I wouldn't have come to the store to do it..I don't like being here. To which he replies "" I like going out."" And mockingly yells "" Let's all raise our voices and protest against how bad the customer service is"".

So...

I have never experienced such behavior from anyone in the service industry. Upon hearing and seeing this, I just turned around and walked out. He still kept yelling and saying something which I could not hear properly.

I just moved from Seattle/Bellevue area. The Xfinity system sucks but at least the people in the stores are decent. The level of incompetence and unprofessionalism in this Lynnwood store is something very amusing.

Still, being inexperienced is acceptable, but being rude to the customers and not being able to understand the frustration and not being able to pacify the situation shows how badly trained this store is.

Personal opinion, don't go to this store. But maybe it was just my bad luck. I hope you don't get treated the same way. I hope things get better and this review makes some difference.

Oh also, the customer service had screwed up the install too. Without internet for a week. Spent around 5 hours on the calls.",1,25-Feb,3655

I was struck, in particular, by the two 20-something year old male employees who were too preoccupied unabashedly watching TikToks or Reels in the wide open literally the entire time I was there to lift a finger. Never have I seen two people be paid to breathe as I did today. Shoutout to Andrew, however.

So the manager feels bad. She says she put in a ticket and she will reach out to me when she fixes my issue. I thank her. So relieved. Months go by, no word. I go in, to ask what the heck is up!? And some sassy dude at reception, tells me he can get me signed in to see one of the reps in store. THE SAME DAMN STORE REPS WHO COULDN’T HELP ME THE DAMN FIRST TIME!!!!!!!! He gives me a card and says to give their online support a call. THE SAME DAMN ONLINE REPS WHO COULDN’T HELP ME EITHER!!!!!!!!

The line isn't long (usually just 2-3 people), but nothing happens and you can wait forever. People realize that and leave after a while, so that’s how there's always 2-3 people. There are only 1-1.5 people working with customers. I have no idea where the rest of the employees are. It seems like they're just sitting in the backend (doing what?)

Xfinity #3752 Roseville,Store Experience | Long Wait Time,"I haven’t visited an Xfinity store in quite some time, but due to some significant issues I was dealing with, I found myself making a trip to the store. This particular location was new to me, and I wasn’t sure what to expect. When I walked in, I was immediately greeted by a welcoming staff member at the entrance, who efficiently added me to the waitlist.

After that, I strolled over to the waiting area, which was pleasantly designed. The space featured a variety of seating options, including plush chairs and cozy small couches, all arranged next to small tables. The atmosphere was surprisingly relaxed, and I appreciated being able to sip on my drink while I waited. What stood out the most was how attentive the staff was; they made regular rounds to check in with everyone, expressing their gratitude for our patience. It felt nice to be acknowledged and valued during what could have been a frustrating wait.

The store was bustling with activity, and I could sense the high demand for their services. When my turn finally came up, I was fortunate enough to be assisted by Catrece. From the moment she approached me, her professionalism and genuine friendliness put me at ease. Although she wasn’t able to resolve every single issue I had, her expertise and guidance were invaluable.

Catrece clearly stood out as a gem among the staff. She was not only well-informed about the various services and products but also possessed an impressive understanding of the technical equipment and how it functioned. I felt like I was in good hands as she patiently answered all my questions, walking me through potential solutions. It was refreshing to encounter someone who truly cared about providing top-notch customer service.

By the end of the interaction, I had a much clearer understanding of my issues and actionable steps to take moving forward. I left the store feeling empowered and relieved, knowing I had a reliable point of contact for any future questions or concerns.

If I face any service challenges again, I have no doubt I’ll skip the Xfinity chat function altogether. Instead, I’ll be heading straight back to this store with the hope of seeing Catrece again.

A huge thanks to Catrece for transforming what could have been a frustrating experience into a truly positive one! It's rare to come across someone who excels in both knowledge and customer engagement, and she has set the standard for what customer service should be like.",5,25-Feb,3752

I'll never spend another dime with xfinity. No wonder there numbers are tanking! Walk in the door and every employee in the store is sitting on their butt staring out the window. You can also not call this store. They do not have a phone. They claimed it was so they could help customers.....how does not having a phone help customers. 6 people were sitting doing NOTHING. Answering a phone would apparently undermine them helping customers....dumbest thing I have ever heard. Just sit around and do nothing. Don't give this company your money. There not at all about customer service. There more for keep billing you and always try to sell you something else when you call the 800 number.,1,25-Feb,3753
Xfinity #3753 Independence,Store Experience | Customer Dissatisfaction,Over all poor service by a female rep at this location. Went to pay my bill as the online service kept rejecting my cards.

Xfinity #3756 St. Louis Park,Store Experience | Staff | Dissatisfaction,"There were no customers in the store when I walked in.  There were 4 gentlemen and 1 woman (employees) talking.
When I told them I was there to troubleshoot my Android phone voicemail, they all turned away looking at each other - presumably wondering who would want to help.  There were no takers, so a manager told them which one it would be.

The gentleman that assisted was able to get part of my issue fixed. YAY!!
The other part, he said he couldn't help with because it is an android and he doesn't have an android phone.  In response, I asked if any of his coworkers might be able to help.
He seemed reluctant, but called someone over to look at it.  Turns out no employees were android users, and no one could help.

It seems to be a standard thing that Comcast/Xfinity employees only have iPhones.  I'd be interested in knowing if that is because xfinity only offers employee discounts on apple products.
If true, it seems like giving employees options (so there would be someone around that is able to help) would be in the best interest of your customers.  I understand that might not be an option.  If true, providing training, would be the way to go.

Additionally, having employees who have a true interest in helping customers, would go a long way in developing a loyal customer base.",2,25-Mar,3756

Xfinity #3758 Minnetonka,Store Experience | Staff | Behaviour Issues,"Went to pick up the new boxes for my mother’s home she is moving into Monday.  She had a service overlap set up through the 12th.  The very unpleasant, untrained, and unprofessional staff completely screwed up the pickup and turned off the service to their existing home.  Hours on hold to try and fix the issue and no Super Bowl for my Viet Nam Veteran, Calvary,  elderly stepfather who has a traumatic brain injury and is relegated to a wheelchair!  Very poor form Xfinity.  You are a predatory company that preys on the communities that you monopolize.  Shame on you, your staff, your board, and executive staff.  Absolutely garbage treatment of an elderly couple, and a client of over 30+ years.

Updated, after being told that there is nothing that they can do because the inept store worker deleted the work order and started everything over we were then disconnected after an hour and a half of working on it, upon dialing right back to get the process back on track we were then told that it would be 24 hours before we could get internet because the phone line had to be reassigned and since it is bundled there is nothing they can do for us.  I guess it is just 48 hours without the pacemaker being monitored, but I am sure we are still going to be billed for this!!  Absolutely the worst company. Although sitting on hold for 45 min game me time to read all about the current CEO who inherited his daddy’s company and pays himself 35+ million per year, and all about how he just purchased a 9 million dollar high rise condo in Hollywood.  Good to know where all the money goes because he definitely doesn’t do anything to service or give back to the communities he preys upon.  Trash!",1,25-Feb,3758

Something that takes mere minutes to do would take you upwards of an hour. The assistance said I have to wait near an hour for my turn. All I needed to do is drop off a cable box. I'm not here for consultation, for new service or for help to solve an issue, I'm here to drop off a cable box. Simple scan the box and I'm on my way. I'm not going to wait an hour for a 5 minute job. They need to reorganize the way they do service. Poor execution of service. I left to drop it off at a ups store, I was in and out in a minutes.

Xfinity #5006 Reston,Store Experience | Staff | Manager Complaints,"(Translated by Google) Reprehensible attention, I don't understand how Latinos can do such a bad job, benefit and cancel lines just to commission and the managers also take advantage of the fact that people don't speak Spanish to humiliate them!!! Terrible service. If you go to this store, don't ask Carlos Contreras to serve you. It is terrible in attention!

"Xfinity #9100 Washington,DC",Store Experience | Customer Dissatisfaction,This xfinity store is awful. Workers are on they phones or online doing personnel things not helping customers. I sat for over a hour while I watched them do everything else but help customers. New management and new workers are needed they're to relaxed at being slow.. This is the worst xfinity store. Giving them 2 stars was being graceful.,2,25-Mar,9100
"Xfinity #9100 Washington,DC",Store Experience | Long Wait Time,Avoid this store. The wait time is worst than the DMV. I had to wait 90 mins just to buy a WIFI extender.,1,25-Jan,9100
"Xfinity #9100 Washington,DC",Store Experience | Long Wait Time,Doesn’t have Customer parking. So if you park on the street be careful if you don’t want a ticket. Will have to wait just to drop off equipment or to be seen. Wait time are based upon how busy the store is which is always in my opinion because it’s the only store in DC.,1,25-Mar,9100
"Xfinity #9100 Washington,DC",Store Experience | Long Wait Time,"Terrible service the guy at the front door was acting like he was very unhappy and the wait time is like going to morgue to view a dead body.
Never going back there again.
I gave them 2 stars because the bathroom was decent.
There were two women employees in the back just kicking the bo -bo.",2,25-Mar,9100
"Xfinity #9100 Washington,DC",Store Experience | Long Wait Time,The worst. I talked with customer service. I came here to pick up router. Information they provide was not enough also customer service saying one thing these people are saying another. Also i had to wait for very long time! If you do not have enough employee to take care of customers why do not get some. This is not customer commitment this is customer punishment,1,25-Mar,9100

"Xfinity #9100 Washington,DC",Store Experience | Staff | Appreciation,I came in to get the modem for my new Wifi account and also wanted to switch phone carriers from my previous phone company. Micah and Eddy helped me out so much with all the difficulties my old company was giving me. They really know what they are doing! They set my new phone up and transferred everything over in a matter of minutes! They were very knowledgeable and professional throughout the whole process and made great recommendations for my plan options. Thank you both so much!,5,25-Jan,9100
"Xfinity #9100 Washington,DC",Store Experience | Staff | Behaviour Issues,"Customer service is terrible, slow and very unprofessional. The people who serve you don't know a lot about many things. The waiting time is one to one and a half hours.",2,25-Feb,9100

Xfinity#1132 Mobile,Store Experience | Long Wait Time,"I appreciate my service with Verizon even more after visiting this Xfinity store. I came in to turn in some equipment for a family member and the service was slow,  the employees were disorganized and lacked motivation/ professionalism. There were 10 people waiting in line and no one to check people in. When someone finally came around asking who arrived first their tablet wasn’t working. So she said “Oh well, y’all just remember your spot in line” and walked away. They did have one person that appeared to be diligently working and know her job but it wasn’t enough…. Overall it was an awful experience, all the customers were very unhappy and we passed the time by commiserating about how bad the service was. When I finally made it through the lady that waited on me smelled like a skunk. I  definitely won’t use Xfinity after going through this.",1,25-Jan,1132
Xfinity#1132 Mobile,Store Experience | Long Wait Time,"Waited for over an hour(got locked in the store after 45 minutes because they had too many people to serve before close) just to be told I would have to come in early in the morning to get my internet set up because the center they needed to do the service closed half an hour ago. Oh, and I have to have a packet of documents just to reinstate service that I had a day ago that I paid for and they randomly cut off. I don't understand the point of having a store location you're told by the phone operators you HAVE to go to, just to have the store employees say they have to call the same phone operator as you.",1,25-Mar,1132
Xfinity#1132 Mobile,Store Experience | Staff | Behaviour Issues,"Yesterday when I visited the Mobile store, to pay a bill. The customer service was horrible. I went at 6 pm and the door was locked. I waited for the customer service representative. To open the door. She looked at me and started to pull the blinds half way down. I had to knock on the door and a customer whom was in the store, asked her to open the door. She had the worst attitude. She stated at 6 pm they are only doing bill pay. I advised her that’s what I was trying to do. If you’re thinking about working with this company DONT!!!! I will be switching my services.",1,25-Feb,1132
Xfinity#1132 Mobile,Store Experience | Staff | Manager Complaints,"The new manager, I think her name was Crystal but today was a mess at the store. I couldn’t believe when I saw the lady talk to two customers for about 10 to 15 minutes before she went over to another associate in the store and dumped the two customers on the associate. And then they were asking for help after the customers were dumped on him, but the manager was literally ignoring them. A girl from the other side of the store, heard her and went to help.",1,25-Mar,1132
